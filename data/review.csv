FPS drops don't affect me with my higher end computer. With the updates, this game feels a lot more like CS:GO than it did a couple months ago. 

The issue with the game is the massive infestation of hackers. Premier, Competetive, High Trust Factor, Low Trust Factor, Prime, Not Prime. You are likely to encounter someone using hacks in AT LEAST 1 in 2 games, if you're lucky.
I've checked in on some of these cheaters, months later, and they still haven't been banned.

76561199353410558,553850,True,0.571195602416992188,Don't pay attention to the negative reviews. It's all Automaton propaganda.
76561199229961087,553850,False,0.567474007606506348,"The game is good however I can't send friend requests for some reason and it fucking pisses me off, I pay $60 for the game and I can't even play with my friends. Fix your game"
76561198131032794,553850,False,0.565217375755310059,"So here's the thing. No one actually likes playing this game right now.
Are they too low level? Kicked from anything below 5 because ""you don't know how to play"" without any check.
Are they too high level? Well then they don't care about the other players goals.
Are you Solo? Game is designed for multiplayer, Die idiot.
Are you playing with Randos? They brought Solo gear so you're going to get friendly fired.
With Friends? Well this is the only way to play this game and have fun, but you could play ANYTHING ELSE. And even then, god Any bug breach or high end enemy and it's just so unenjoyable that you're swearing the entire time and pissed at the end.

And yes, the entire game is about the meme of pretending to be an ODST or Starship Trooper or EDF, but you can play both of those, right now, instead. The other meme of being HYPER DEMOCRATIC AND FREEDOM FOR SUPER EARTH loses it's charm after 5 Charger spawns happen in 1 map.

The thing is, this game could be good. Drop friendly fire lower, lower enemy damage, remove every enemy being able to call reinforcements, Lower Slow duration or Bile, have Orbital and Eagle strikes display where they'll hit for new players, Level up until your Orbitals have better targeting, give tags to weapons for if they're suggested for Solo or Group Play, give tutorials to new players on how to deal with Chargers and Bile Titans, teach players that you don't HAVE to fight every encounter and aggro is dangerous.

But that comes with too much work for the Devs right now, along side all the additional stuff they want to add to the game to make it last longer for everyone because we're all very inclined to level to max asap.

So come back a bit later, chill when you're not feeling it, and try other stuff in the meanwhile. It'll get better."

Some players are annoying and rude, everyone are going to be upset that hard mode is hard, but if you get three friends and a few hours? There is no better feeling than everyone getting synced up and dueling a massive swarm of monsters or robots. It gets consistent updates, the devs work hard and are pretty transparent.

I love that you don't have to pay for the in game currency for the premium battle pass and it is something you can earn very easily with the FREE battle pass that the currency for that you can only use playing the game rather than begging you for more money after paying a good sum for the game itself.

76561198028062051,553850,False,0.539434850215911865,"The game was very fun when released but developer choices after release look like they want grab loads of money and kill the game. Going in the direction of one-dimensional gameplay. 

Issues: 

Server issues at launch were not their fault, nobody expected this game to blow up.

Money: 
Game being released for one month and we already have two packs of weapons and armors released as essentially battle-passes for ¬£8 each. It is understandable for a game to do this a few months after release but the game sold far more than anyone expected and they are still trying to cash grab. It is a very greedy choice by the developer. 

Anti-Cheat: 
Why have a kernel level anti-cheat for a PvE game. The Anti-cheat is not even good, it blocks windows power-tools rebinds as it thinks it is a cheat. 

Stability: 
This is very obvious a not good playstation port. The game crashes often, even a month after release. There are so many bugs with keyboard and mouse input. It is possible to have a good playstation port, but this is so buggy and feels half finished. 

Balancing: 
Devs are choosing to nerf ""the meta"" stuff rather than actually balance the weapons. The things they nerfed were overpowered but they haven't actually balanced anything. Most weapons in the game are still basically useless. They say they want the game to be difficult which is good but it still has to be fun. They say they don't want everyone to have to bring loads of anti-armor into a mission but majority of enemies require them. 
Too many enemies only have one way to kill them. They have specifically said this themselves with recent update. Weak points on enemies is important for people to actually know where to kill and the bigger enemies the very obvious weak point is not a weak point. Instead devs just want you to aim for the head every-time. Makes it very one dimensional. Instead of being difficult from tactical point of view, it is just difficult because they overload you with enemies with armor and you run out of ways (ammo or stratagems) to kill them.  

Always Online:
This is a PvE game, if you can not connect to the servers, you can not play the game. This just guaranties the game will die and be unplayable. 

I would not buy this game as it looks like it will just become a Payday 2 situation with having hundreds of DLC you have to pay for not fun gameplay."
76561198023082165,553850,True,0.536784708499908447,Take back control of Freedom. Join the fight for Managed Democracy!
76561198002756667,553850,True,0.532163739204406738,"9.8/10, Love the game, can't get enough.

What do I like about Helldivers 2?
- The gameplay. Balanced, challenging, engaging, fun, and dynamic. Lots of decisions to make about what toys to bring along, what objectives to pursue, how to manage your time and resources to get the most out of each round. 
- The online elements are very well designed, and work well despite having a few teething problems. Even though it's ""only"" 4 player co-op, the community contributes towards larger goals, which makes the universe feel WAY more alive.
- The music is epic, and contextually adaptive; it's quiet when things are calm, and bombastic when the action picks up.
- The sound design is fantastic, everything feels so substantial -- from artillery fire and orbital strikes, to footsteps, gunshots, character voices that sound more exasperated if you're at low health for example
- Graphics are gorgeous, environments are varied and vibrant
- Daily objectives and a rotating item shop give you an extra little something to look forward to when you log in
- Microtransactions are available but totally optional, as the Super Credits are also found during missions.
- Weapons and armor aren't locked to a specific loadout, so for example your medic could carry a bazooka and an ammo support backpack, or you can hand off your high level weapons to the newbie on the team so he can have an easier time. Some weapons can be team-loaded, like the rocket launchers and autocannons, so the weapons themselves encourage cooperation and coordination.

So I like a lot about the game. What do I think could be improved?
- There's a handful of bugs that can get in the way, but are either fixable or tolerable, and are constantly subject to change; the Devs of the game are right on top of it with the bug fixes and balance updates. I'm confident they'll iron out all of the teething issues very quickly.

It's literally a malware rootkit configured to monitor for cheats (and potentially send data to the company that made nProtect). nProtect GameGuard is also known to run even when the game isn't being played, so it makes you wonder if its recording your data and sending it out. It's also notoriously difficult to remove it from your system since it literally modifies and adds things to the Windows Registry. There is a forum here full of details on user experiences with nProtect and its BAD, like one person had to do a system wipe because it broke his Operating System. 

This happened because of the anti cheat essentially giving itself Root 0 (Kernal) access to your PC, basically its a super administrator and it can change and monitor ANYTHING in your system's software and hardware. You on the other hand have at most Root 2 permissions as a user, not even admin permissions which is Root 1. There's also the privacy concern as well as extremely dangerous security holes opened up because of nProtect GameGuard. Hackers have a dangerous advantage in this situation and gain complete control of your system if they managed to exploit your system.

Arrowhead Game Studio if your reading this, please consider an anti cheat that doesn't run with Kernal 0 access. I don't trust a 3rd party having extreme access to my computer to potentially send or change data, just me using Microsoft Windows is bad enough for privacy.

For now I won't be playing this game on my bare metal system. I'm going to try Virtual Machine gaming lol. I will delete this review when they have removed this destructive anti cheat malware."

=====[/b]

Helldivers 2 expands upon the lore established in the original game, delving deeper into the conflict between humanity and the alien forces (Terminids, Automatons and soon to appear Illuminates). The story follows the exploits of the Helldivers as they battle across diverse worlds fighting to secure humanity's survival. While the narrative takes a backseat given the game's action-packed nature, there are plenty of lore scattered throughout the game for those who want to delve deeper into the backstory.


[b]Gameplay:
========[/b]

At its core, Helldivers 2 is all about teamwork and coordination. Players assume the role of elite soldiers known as Helldivers, tasked with defending humanity against alien threat. The goal is simple: complete missions, eliminate enemies, and spread democracy across the galaxy.

The gameplay loop is addictive and endlessly replayable. Each mission presents unique challenges and objectives, requiring players to adapt their strategies on the fly. Whether you're engaging in intense firefights, calling in airstrikes, or deploying automated turrets, every decision you make can mean the difference between victory and defeat.

As you progress, you'll unlock new weapons, utilities, and strategems, allowing for greater customization and specialization. Whether you prefer to wield heavy weaponry, support your team with distributing ammo, unleash devastating orbital strikes, or even sneak around, there's a playstyle to suit every preference.


[b]GFX:
====[/b]

One of the first things that strikes you about Helldivers 2 is its outstanding visuals. The game boasts stunning graphics that immerse players in its richly detailed environments, from lush alien jungles to desolate wastelands. Every explosion, every enemy encounter is brought to life with breathtaking fidelity, making for a truly cinematic experience.


[b]Sound FX:
========[/b]

Accompanying the stellar visuals is a soundtrack that elevates the intensity of gameplay. From pulse-pounding combat themes to haunting melodies that underscore the game's darker moments, the sound design in Helldivers 2 is nothing short of exceptional. Every gunshot, every explosion, is a symphony of chaos that adds to the immersive experience.


[b]Issues, concerns and a positive note:
=============================[/b]

Despite its many strengths, the game is not without its flaws. The game's unexpected success has brought to light several issues, including a lack of CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) checks, network instabilities, the occasional bugs, glitches and so on. While these issues don't detract significantly from the overall experience, they can be frustrating and detract from the game's polish. While Arrowhead Game Studios has been responsive to player feedback and has released patches to address some of the aforementioned, there's still room for improvement in this area.

Arrowhead Game Studios created this gem and are small compared to the size of other studios, one could only imagine how much pressure said success added to the studio. Regardless of their size, I tip my hat for putting a lot of AAA studios to shame which have been disappointing us for many years. This studio alongside Larian Studios have brought back the quality of game development which gamers missed for a very long time. I wish Arrowhead Game Studios the best and I hope they can keep themselves afloat by harnessing their mental health, taking proper time off and by recruiting extra developers to retain success in a balanced sense.


[b]Conclusion and Pricetag:
===================[/b]

Helldivers 2 is currently the king of cooperative gaming, offering a thrilling experience that is sure to delight fans and enthusiasts of the genre alike. With its outstanding graphics, solid gameplay mechanics, and immersive audio design, it sets a new standard for what a cooperative shooter and a small development studio can achieve. While its unexpected success has brought some technical issues to light, the sheer fun and excitement of battling alien hordes with friends more than make up for any shortcomings. If you're looking for a game that will keep you entertained for hours on end, Helldivers 2 is the perfect choice. Its well worth the price. A solid 9/10 from this old gaffer.

76561198053189918,553850,True,0.525862038135528564,Lots of action and adrenaline as your life will constantly be in danger and you will blow a lot of stuff up and it will be awesome
76561198110822777,553850,True,0.525862038135528564,"It's safe to say that Helldivers 2, only being out for a month, sits pretty comfortably among the big hitters of co-op shooters (Deep Rock Galactic and GTFO) for good reason. Straightforward spectale gameplay but with a good amount of depth in various areas so it rarely gets stale. A solid sense of community and comradery due to the game's excellent Starship Troopers-esque setting and satire. Best of all, the game's monetization is VERY generous; the ""premium pass"" is bought with a premium currency you can find ingame, so with time, you could just get it for free.

Game is obviously not flawless, but in all honesty, it's really close to it. The only real problem I see with the game, which is noted but somewhat exaggerated by many, is the game's balance. Yes, there are some weapons that really don't feel good to use because of their lackluster performance, and some specific enemies might feel a bit frustrating to fight at times, but devs are constantly listening and taking feedback, but they're definitely not the type to fold under pressure and compromise their vision of the game.

Only thing I can see being a problem for anyone planning to play this game long-term, and I leave this at the end because this is literally case-by-case, is any possible skill issue you might have. I do not want to imply that you need to ""git gud"" in order to enjoy this game, I just wanna throw out this disclaimer, so let me explain: (This is a bit of a write-up, so if you don't really care, just stop reading and move on.)

The highest available tier of difficulties at the time of this review is Levels 7, 8, and 9 (these are ""Suicide Mission"", ""Impossible"", and ""Helldive"" respectively), and they're notable because the enemies are at their strongest; some of them get new attacks and the toughest enemies available in a given faction start to appear more often. By the way, enemy health doesn't scale in this game, neither by difficulty or player count, just the way their spawns work and for some, new attacks. Due to this, you will have to properly sort out your loadout to accommodate the enemy's new forces, and especially at 8 or 9, you might need to consider what your teammates are bringing to be better equipped for every threat available.

To some, the requirement to utilize particular loadouts better (which inevitably means not everything is viable), synergizing and working with your team, for sometimes handling absurd odds, is what makes these difficulties enjoyable. You can get a serious rush out of the tense situations these difficulties can put you through, and even if it may be a bit frustrating at times, there's a reason why the team gets 5 respawns per person in the squad. 

By playing these difficulties, you are rewarded with the opportunity to obtain a resource needed for endgame upgrades. (These are the ONLY way to obtain said resource at the time of this review).

To others however, the chaos is too much and one's loadout options closing up a bit in terms of viability isn't liked, which is a fair view to have. The ""medium"" tier of difficulty, being 4, 5, and 6, keep you closer to the sort of spectacle shooter, blow-stuff-up immersion the game starts you out with, where you can use just about anything and still blast apart bugs and tear up the robot menace just fine without too much push back or resistance to face. Unfortunately though, this means that people that only play this tier of difficulty, means they'll never get said resource from the high-tier difficulty range, and therefore can't obtain those endgame upgrades.

Now, I still think the game can be enjoyed by EVERYONE, and there is no fault to playing these lower difficulties. However, sometimes, (especially on the subreddit) some people will beg for some way to earn that endgame resource without having to play on those difficulties, which I always thought is such a weird stance: I would understand making these difficulties easier, but asking to just completely avoid playing it at all, yet still harvest the rewards from it, rubs me the wrong way. 

What I'm trying to say, is that if you want to get the endgame resources and max out your progression, you will, at the time of this review, be required to play those high level difficulties that is just too hard for some. I implore you that if you really want to set your sights on those endgame resources, you should expect to have the power fantasy be challenged a bit more, and be ready to adapt and get better, because it's intentional by the devs to have it be that way.

The greatest disservice you would do for yourself is cling too hard to feeling invincible in the medium tiers of difficulty, then make no change to adapt and improve for the sake of the higher tiers. Power fantasy is something everyone craves, but just know that to some, achieving victory when that fantasy is challenged is a good feeling to have, not some sort of masochism kink that some insist is what truly goes down in higher tiers of difficulty.

That's all about my personal stance on things, but realistically you will have to play yourself to form your own opinion. Just stop reading this review, get the game, shoot up some bugs and bots, and have a good time."

76561198019366608,553850,True,0.523809552192687988,"Unlike my last two reviews, Darktide and Enshrouded, HD2 I can review without having 150+ hours in. This game is an absolute blast, and I really would encourage you--if you ever enjoyed killing things with guns in a video game and screaming with excitement in RL as you do it--then go ahead and buy it now.

This game company has a history of knowing how to put together meticulously crafted systems to create fun game play, as shown by iconic titles like Gauntlet and Magicka. Their frenetic space shooter, Helldivers, recalled Starship Troopers (when fighting bugs instead of the bots) with a wonderful assortment of personal weaponry, differently perked suits, and the widest array of support weapons, attack air strikes, and orbital-based strikes I've seen anywhere--not to mention playing a mech. The figures in HD were small and that reduced immersion, but the systems of HD2 got well test-driven there. Now, HD2 brings amazing over-the-shoulder shooter or FPS to the screen with amazing environments and varied biomes, trees that shatter and other destructible terrain, multiple currency systems for advancing widely varied and numerous suits, and weaponry, equipment or cosmetics, and ship-based assets. Both characters and battles are leveled in access to stuff or difficulty, respectively, accompanied by Helldivers' wildly over-the-top rah-rah shouts of ""you are the best in the universe"" and ""spread some democracy!"" If you've got a funny bone and a taste for irony, the game context is hilarious. Only in this world does it make any kind of sense to chuck a grenade at somebody and shout ""taste some liber-tea!!!""

HD2 is completely co-op and the interface works well although the game has been so danged popular sometimes their servers can take a while to get the ball rolling. Unlike games like Starfield and even Darktide, though HD2 can be demanding on a system with a zillion particle effects and environmental objects, it still runs great on an HDD and a Gen 9 machine like mine. My son is a successful indie game developer and I have never heard him whoop and holler like he does when playing HD2 -- the game can be one of the most fun and crazy-paced shooters there is, while every mission provides the option of doing all the objectives or only a few -- be warned: the federation will reward you accordingly! And in this context, dying and not making it to the ex-fil craft doesn't mean you lost. It means your character--at least that iteration of him/her--will be rewarded posthumously, and you can use all the rewards in the next run.

As I write this early in the game's release, I'm hoping the devs will continue tweaking this masterpiece that they have been developing for so long! Even HD2--though I would encourage you to buy it now at full price--is not perfect. Here are a few denig deets: 1. the game in some ways can become less fun as you go up in level. The reason is that the opposition becomes so overwhelming that you are then advised to take a sneakier, more commando approach, to wreaking destruction. But that is def not the best feel of this game and not where it's the most fun. This is definitely not Thief 2, Deus Ex, or even Dead by Daylight where we just try to dodge the monsters. This is definitely kill the bigger baddies with even bigger guns!!! So, we hope the devs will keep tweaking the balance at higher levels. In addition to being less fun when played that way, a lot of the best modules and items are locked behind success-based currencies, and we don't want to sneak in fear when we want to be blazing away! 

2. The warbond system, while workable and providing a lot of great new stuff, still requires you to buy a lot of stuff you wouldn't choose to buy otherwise just to get the next page unlocked. I don't like this arm twisting but I can't see how to fix it. It is an advancement system of a type, and maybe I will try to look at it as with other systems, where you pick up things you don't use. Still... I really don't like paying for it when I've ""earned"" the medals (=coin).

3. Finally, and related to my first neg, the devs are currently messing with spawn rates. It used to be that the most dangerous of bugs, the charger, would sometimes appear 2-4 at a time and there are VERY few ways to kill them. Then, they nerfed some of the ways so there are even fewer ways to kill them. And then I guess they decided they better reduce the rate of this bug tanks and replace them with many more of the tough medium armor bugs... and now there are so many once you get to hard and above, that sometimes they'll immobilize and stun-lock players and then hop as a group to the next player-victim. This is also not fun, and will require tweaking again on spawns and on systems.

But don't let these three expressions of honesty deter you. HD2 is an instant best, and it gives you so many options to figure how to solve the tactical problems you're facing right now. Alongside Darktide, and above Outriders, this is now my favorite far sci-fi shooter, and it's a gas!"
76561199584972116,553850,True,0.523809552192687988,"An honest review: 

pros: do you like horde shooters? do you like killing time on 40 min missions? like to play with friends? this is the game for you. for me the game play mechanics are good work well, love the concept of the game as a whole a basic run and gun game with a basic looting system with no need to farm out guns in a sense of doing the same mission over and over again to get a single weapon you will earn all weapons with relative ease no matter the mission via there medal system

cons: this game is decently new so expect some things not to work properly, meaning the game will still have bugs, the game will potentially crash, you will more than likely have higher level people queuing up and get loaded into you mission, the anti cheat software also has some bad rep to their name as seen in a good amount of negative comments about the game. 

aside from the cons it was worth the money for me. the game still has room to grow, stick with the community and help the game grow"

"
76561197973287620,553850,True,0.523809552192687988,"Initially skeptical about the TPS shift from Helldivers 1, the anti-cheat software, and a host of launch issues; despite these, there's immense joy in this gameplay.  The co-op centric managed chaos is a thrilling gaming experience with friends and randoms alike.

Launch issues: I still don't think they've figured out their title, the strength of it, and the full potential of continuing momentum on this game, but the core components of the gameplay and theme have fit an obvious need in the gaming space that have absolutely outpaced whatever issues they've had in launching. It is also difficult to hold unplanned, overwhelming success against them.  Hopefully, they'll find their way with balancing as it seems a bit unplanned and chaotic right now with extreme shifts.

Anti-cheat: To be determined, I suppose; not a good company reputation, but my rig hasn't detonated nor have my innermost private thoughts intercepted and fed to Klaus's mind demons yet (that I know of).

Third Person: I was expecting this title to be incredibly bland with the shift to TPS away from the isometric/top down sticker shooter format of the first.  I was wrong.  This is a great example of making a perspective conversion work wonders yet still retaining the strengths of the first.  Even retaining the strategem combos still works in TPS instead of stick shooter.  Much more options of immersion and chaos exist now as well.

Some notable takeaways for the rest of the industry:

1) Starship Troopers game creators -- looking at all of you;  these guys here nailed the atmosphere/satire while still nodding to the source books lightly, developing the themes fully to a point that they own, without paying licensing or relying on the ST brand.  Every ST game since Starship Troopers: Terran Ascendancy has been lazy in writing and inspiration -- expecting the brand to carry their game instead of pumping it full of originality and good mechanics.  This studio hasn't even leaned hard into their worldbuilding/themes yet.  Just a few videos, visual style, and and some dialogue.  The increased merging of reality (patches/notes/development) and their in-game universe is an amazing opportunity for continued momentum.  Even more shockingly, this game actually captures the maneuver tactics in the book more than the movie(s) or games: a highly mobile orbital drop force that audaciously, individually screams out of orbit, fucks maximum amounts of shit up quickly, and beats feet to the retrieval boat before an orbital time window expires.  The book spelled it out -- it is the core capability of the mobile infantry that feeds the culture so many love and recognize even in the movie.  This studio did it -- and ST game creators somehow never did.

2) Guns, violence, bravado, and jingoism. These are traditionally masculine related themes. They're also fun in games -- much less fun in reality.  People in this game are having fun.  So much fun, that many gamers are buying this game because they're not getting the same cultural themes and experience elsewhere. Deviate from the core target audiences at your own peril.

I can see how this game may become repetitive after some sessions, but I enjoy the difficulty and look forward to the evolving changes.

76561199064532609,553850,True,0.523809552192687988,"As a fan of both Suicide Squad and the Justice League, I was eagerly anticipating this crossover event. However, what I got was far from what I expected, and not in a good way.

Firstly, let's talk about the gameplay. It's clunky, repetitive, and feels like a chore rather than an enjoyable experience. The controls are a mess, making even simple tasks frustratingly difficult. It's as if the developers didn't bother to playtest the game before release.

The story, which could have been a saving grace, falls completely flat. It's a disjointed mess that tries too hard to be edgy and ends up feeling forced. The attempts at humor are cringeworthy at best, and the dialogue is so poorly written that it's almost painful to listen to.

Now, onto the main selling point: killing the Justice League. This should have been a thrilling, satisfying experience, but it's anything but. The battles are tedious, with repetitive mechanics that quickly become tiresome. There's no sense of accomplishment or excitement when you finally take down a member of the Justice League‚Äîit just feels like you're going through the motions.

Graphically, the game is a mixed bag. While the environments can look stunning at times, the character models are often stiff and lifeless. It's clear that more effort was put into the scenery than the actual characters you're supposed to care about.

Overall, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a major letdown. It's a prime example of style over substance, with lackluster gameplay, a forgettable story, and unimpressive visuals. Save your money and play something else‚Äîanything else."

76561198254632111,553850,True,0.523809552192687988,"I would recommend this game for when the following get fixed:

-enemy spawns are obscenely unpredictable. youll be left wondering why automatons even bother using dropships if the vast majority just spontaneously materialize right behind you. eliminating any strategy you might come up with. the same issue can be said with the bugs. normally there is orange smoke signifying the origin of the bug breach, only it doesnt matter because bugs will also spawn all around you. (so dont bother taking cover, theres nowhere to hide. dont bother prioritising different strategems for different strategies, because the only thing there is for you to do is chase the current meta to stay alive.)

-enemy balance. the automatons are the exception to this category, as the automatons are perfectly balanced. bugs however are insane, more specifically the hunters. they do way to much damage for how fast they can close the gap on you + how many spawn in a given moment.

-armor. amor has very little consequence in survivability except for speed. movement speed is going to affect your gameplay far more than any of the other armor stats. theres no point in wearing heavy armor (other than the fact most of them look the coolest), as the enemies regularly make headshots like its going out of style (also there is no difference in the amount of armor your helmets provide)."
76561198027787229,553850,True,0.523809552192687988,"Helldivers 2 is an incredible squad-based co-op shooter brimming with satire.  It wears its influences on its sleeve, and pays direct homage to many beloved science fiction franchises such as Starship Troopers, Aliens, Terminator, Halo, Warhammer 40K, etc.  

As far as gameplay is concerned, it manages to capture the frenetic energy, absolute chaos, and nearly infinite replayability of early horde mode multiplayer games like Mass Effect 3, Gears of War 2, and Halo 3: ODST, but with the addition of objective-based missions on vast, open world maps.  The level of environmental detail and heavy reliance on subtle, diegetic storytelling is nothing short of astounding.  I haven't had this much fun with a co-op shooter since I was wiping out waves and waves of Reapers with my Asari Vanguard on ME3 multiplayer's highest difficulty setting.

For those who may be skeptical of a live service game like this one, I can say with confidence that the monetization model is one of the most fair that I have ever seen, and I have never felt pressured to spend my money.  I do anyway, however, because it's inexpensive and worth every penny.  Plus, you can earn premium currency (Super Credits) just by playing the game.  It's not a lot, but I have managed to make a few purchases without spending any real money at all.

I was a cynic about the initial hype for this game so I'm making this review to tell you, the hype is justified. It released in February and straight away is a strong contender for game of the year,

- ""They nerfed the railgun waaaaa, why don't they just buff everything else to be super powerful and OP""
The railgun was hands down brokenly useful. It did the job of Anti-tank like weaponry but better (More ammo, faster reload+reload on the move, generous ammo pickups, didn't take a backpack slot, could be used generously on hive guards, brood commanders, spewers with no discretion for wasting the ammo.) People who argue this say the devs don't want you to have fun, I think they've got a different idea of what fun most people are looking for in this game. Yes it is fun to stomp all the bugs out with one gun, it's not fun to trivialise the enemy into a point where they only exist to slow you down from grinding numbers.

- Mechs don't win the entire match for me, they can't be reloaded, they die to easy.
Yeah, duh, same point as the railgun... it takes only one stratagem spot and is a token solution to every TERMINID enemy. The gun has enough ammo to hold down a large hive or breach and hold a zone in safety for an extended period of time while having enough rockets to take out around 4 chargers or 3 bile titans (Depends on how good/lucky your rocket shots are) all by yourself. That's doing a lot of work for one stratagem. Reloading it would make harder difficulties trivial and it already has like a 12 minute cooldown and can only be called twice... but yes, it's ridiculous easy to kill yourself with it (i'm pretty sure if you don't let the mech finish turning enough when you fire the rocket it shoots into the side of you and insta-kills you) and good luck against automaton rockets.

I've already wasted more time than the braindead complaints are worth. It's a good game, the vocal minority make it sound like a toxic wasteland."

Granted all I ever play are competitive games so usually this isn't my cup of tea. However, Helldivers 2 combined with a group of friends is some of the most fun I've had in gaming.

The only downside currently is the balancing. If you don't have a group of friends, don't bother going in for a solo mission on a medium (4-5) difficulty. The way the balancing makes the game harder is by just spamming the most obnoxious enemies and throwing them all at you in a big cluster. That and just giving you more stronger enemy types. No stratagem or gun can save you when there's 1 or 2 bug breaches full of hunters running and jumping at you.

[b]TL;DR:[/b] Overall, a game that focuses on being fun and easy to get into, with developers who are paying attention to their product and interacting with the community. A rare 10/10.

[b]Premise:[/b] [i]Helldivers 2[/i] is as it advertises, a third-person combat shooter that pits you against an assortment of alien insectoids and robots with a slowly expanding assortment of weapons and equipment.

[b]Format:[/b] Missions ranging from 12 to 40 minutes in length can be engaged from the mission table, with a variety of styles such as killing enemies around towers, killing enemies while you blow things up, killing enemies while you perform chores, or just killing enemies.

[b]Tech:[/b] [i]Arrowhead[/i] have learned from the vastly underestimated interest in their game at launch. Though servers are sometimes a little strained or slow, gameplay is generally unimpeded. The client is moderately stable; while crashes occur, they are infrequent.

[b]Requirements:[/b] [i]Helldivers 2[/i] runs as smoothly on an 11 year old machine as it does a 6 month old one. Obviously mileage differs, but it‚Äôs encouraging to see decently-optimised code. That said, it is a co-op game, and a decent internet connection is needed."

If you want to feel like the resistance against the Terminators or a Roughneck killing bugs this game is perfect for you. Now let me get to why I cannot recommend this game to other people: the pay-to-play. 

When first released there were two Warbonds, one everybody had access to the other cost 1000 Super Credits (SC) which could be bought with real world money ($20USD = 2100SC). SC can also be acquired through the regular Warbond (700 SC in total) leaving 300 more before you could buy the other Warbond. The last way to get SC is in missions that have a 40 minute timer (they can be done in about 20 minutes with a good squad), and in my experience, can have 0-20. This means that if you get lucky, and have a good squad, you're looking at nearly five hours on JUST those missions. Now you have both Warbonds...then they came with the new patch adding another Warbond locked behind another 1000 SC. So now you need to play 17 hours of just those missions, with a good squad and getting lucky again to buy it. 

This would not be so bad if every mission gave the option to get some SC, if they were found in larger quantities, or if they added a way to convert your endless (and at a certain point useless) regular credits and samples into SC. Oh I also mentioned the worst part about these ""Warbonds"" is they don't just contain cosmetics but weapons and armor ONLY available in the Warbond.

That's right, if you want to use the armor that gives you survive-ability against the coming illuminate or the breaker with incendiary rounds? Better be ready to fork out 25% of the cost of the base game or devote yourself to running the same missions again and again for what boils down to two whole work days. Reminds me a bit of the whole Starwars Battlefront fiasco, except here the loot isn't random and it isn't PvP.

Cons:
-certain side missions are bugged, making them borderline impossible
-learning curve has a steep cliff
-the game seems to want you to use orbital strikes/airstrikes to deal with bad situations, but spawns are so constant that all 4 players will have things on cooldown as the mission goes on, and in maps where the objective forces the squad to stay in one place the mission can become unwinnable as resources become exhausted.
-certain enemies currently are overtuned
--hunters can spam a leap that instantly closes to melee range, their melee attacks deal roughly 50% hp and slow you
--chargers are hulking tanks that ignore all attacks that don't deal armor-piercing, which surprisingly is not all support weapons, also spam a charge that runs faster and has a better turn radius than a soldier
--bile titans also cannot be killed without armor-piercing
--all problem enemies spawn at massive rates starting at difficulty 7, which is the difficulty most player want to reach in order to farm materials for ship upgrades

Currently the devs seem to be courting the hardcore crowd by tuning everything towards players that have a static group to co-op with so every player is high-performing and has a role-specific loadout.

Graphics are good, but repetitive too.
AI seems OK, they are bugs or mechs/robot/terminators and once in a while sneak up and surprise you.
Player movement and animations needs work.

However what I really don't like is all the different currencies you need to collect to upgrade. The fact that rich people can buy there way up the ladder and the rest have to grind a never ending quest exactly like the last quest, flip the switch, power on a battery, protect until moving to the same thing, 2 or 2 millions times in a row. I saw a mission once, to infiltrate a big bug hide out, click, sorry quest no longer exists. Now I don't know why you would to spend money on any of this digital crap that disappears once the game is dead but to each his own. Why speed up the end game with cash... But I digress. I'll digress more if you keep reading...

Next topic of contention, you have to work your way up to map difficulty. Oh please, let me die a thousand deaths on ultra hard, at least I get to see some new bug or mech that motivates me to grind some more to one day kick it's ass.

Silly PlayStation link to Steam BS to make shareholders think somehow Sony is getting an influx of new users. Shares going through the roof, I think not. Lame. Make it seamless, I have enough titles on steam from other distributors that did the link without making ""ME"" jump through any hoops. I'm the customer or have you forgotten. You do the back-end work! Either pay your Devs better or don't let marketing make the decisions about installation and account linking. What is this 2001?

Lastly why on earth does a co-op game need an anti-cheat system. Stats? Upgrades? Likely they don't want people ripping off outfits or weapons. Protecting a digital outfit from be stolen is a rip off in itself. Wake up!

Other than that it is fun with friends for a bit. Buy it on sale @ $20, not $40 and for gods sake don't purchase anything in game. This model kills game play."

76561199517670704,1086940,True,0.545454561710357666,"      This game goes beyond great. It is a masterwork of storytelling, gameplay and characters. I don't think I'll ever truly leave this game, the Minecraft of my adult years. I believe I will be on my deathbed still petting Scratch. I initially refunded this game (I view this as blasphemy at this point.) I did not believe I would be able to play through it without becoming bored when it was in early release, I never had much patience for turn based combat nor listening to endless dialogue. I eventually picked it up again after the full release and booted it up willing to give it another try, I didn't realize I had played for 5 hours until I finally stopped to go to the bathroom. 

      This is the type of game that you will throw everything else away for, I lost a girlfriend over this game, not completely because of this game granted ;) (she was constantly eating all my food and yelling at me.) But I made an active choice to break up with her to play this game. That may be mental illness but I don't regret it one bit. Gave me more time to spend with this fantastic game. It got me through constant bouts of depression and medical procedures. It wouldn't be much of a stress to say this game saved my life. 

     The only other games that made me feel like this were Elden Ring, and RDR2, both games which I have replayed over 8 times. It gives you this sense of inhabiting the world ,much like ER and RDR2, not just playing through the motions and skipping dialogue to get to the mediocre gameplay. You aren't playing a game but living in a world full of choices and complex characters. You will meet an NPC that is a complete jackass but still manages to have more depth and nuance than any protagonist a Ubisoft-like company could ever dream of. The replayability is astounding. So many builds and choices that even after 200 hours I feel I haven't even sratched (heh) the surface of this game.

    I may be going overboard with my praise and writing too much but a game like this deserves it. If you have the funds and don't mind spending a little extra please buy the deluxe edition, we need Larian to keep making games like this and keep raising the standard for gaming in general. I love this game so dearly, returning to replay feels like visiting a loved one. I'm always so happy to find time to spend on this fantastic game. 

      A few suggestions for new players, please don't skip dialogue, (even with Wyll) for every new area make sure the whole map is discovered, explore every corner, interact with everyone and take your time with this game. The first playthrough is magical and worth investing every second. If you get hooked it'll grab you like few other games will. I would keep writing but I need to get back to my sweet sassy babies. Thank you Larian for making a game like this in my lifetime, I am and will be eternally grateful.

76561198257483048,1086940,True,0.525316417217254639,"An astonishing achievement for RPGs that is let down by its technical shortcomings, Baldur's Gate 3 is currently an enjoyable but messy experience. With the number of permutations and combinations this game is juggling it's understandable why some moments can break, but it is especially frustrating when the game otherwise reacts to player creativity. The storyline and dialogue was well-written and exceptionally performed, but when you transition from top down to cinematic your expectations change, and I do not think BG3 fully met mine. The companions are generally decent, but I did not enjoy their company as much as I thought I would. I was also not a big fan of the music, which really impacts the way I enjoy games. I find Divinity Original Sin's gameplay systems preferable to D&D, but maybe I'm just nostalgic. 

Overall I do think this is a great game, but I'm surprised to say that it's not my game of the year, and it might even be a tad over-hyped. I might change my mind after another playthrough, but I do not feel the urge to do that just yet."

76561197976550723,1086940,True,0.523809552192687988,"As a huge Baldur's Gate fan I was so excited to hear BG3 was going to be made. The fact that it was to be made by Larian studios made it even more exciting as I really liked the Divinity Original Sin series they created which had huge attention to detail and great role playing as the focus. I won't lie and say I wasn't a bit concerned and disappointed at first when I found it wouldn't be isometrical with play and pause like the previous Black Isle Studios Infinity Engine games (BG series, Icewind Dale series, and Planescape Torment) as I loved them all. But after delving into the early access I found it to feel really good. The next few years in EA did it so much good. 

Once it went live I created a character (Dark Urge as it fit in with my past time beating the previous entries) and set out on adventure. And what an adventure it is! This game not only did feel like a Baldur's Gate game, but it has to be the closest I've ever come to playing D&D in a virtual world over anything I've played before. Neverwinter Nights held some of that feel but this delivered that feel in choice and detail as well.  The story is extremely well done and the characters are absolutely amazing. I felt myself very connected with my companions and even felt saddened at their storylines and feelings of joy when things worked out well with them. The humor and interactions between the companions are fantastic and caused me to have great care for the outcome of their tale.

The amount of things that you can do in this game and the attention to detail and allowing you to try and experiment with so many different things it's just amazing when it comes to video games. You don't see this level very often if at all by other developers especially by big named companies. The rule set is 5E and I found that the system is very well implemented into the game. I truly enjoyed leveling my character seeing the different weapons and items and the combinations that I could pull off and even found myself looking forward to future playthroughs trying different character classes, skills, and abilities. There's even an amazing amount of interactions and choices to be made based off of your race, class, and things that you have done which allows for so much diversity in your builds and gameplay and multiple run throughs. The amount of times I found secrets and secret areas and choice differences in this is on an unprecedented level when it comes to games. As for replayability, I'm older now I don't have the amount of time I used to when I was younger to play games. The fact that I'm already planning on future playthroughs on a game I have already spent hundreds of hours on and already beaten  is saying a lot for me and is a considerably feat. There is truly more content in this game than many other games combined.

The game mechanics on display are a site to behold. I enjoyed practically every aspect of things I could do and the structures to which the game functioned on. The combat should be mentioned as well. It feels very tight and well constructed. It functions just like tabletop D&D with initiative orders, your full sets of spells, skills, and abilities that feels so well done I found myself looking forward to the fights in the game. Also it should be said that the amount of different D&D monsters , both classic and newer, tickled me to no end. I found myself getting excited when I stumbled upon monsters that I didn't expect to see, or ones that you don't normally see  in video games even other D&D games. Hags, gnolls, harpies, and hook horrors just to name a few.

Multiplayer is extremely well implemented as well. I never had a problem joining a game or having someone join mine and found a multiplayer added a whole new level to the game outside of the single player. Not only did you have an amazing story to play, but you find that by playing with others it introduces a new dynamic allowing for some great situations of tactics and just plain hilarious moments. The multiplayer is very impressive and a welcome addition to this phenomenal game.

As far as cons or negative things to say about the game, I would find myself nitpicking trying to find something bad. I will say the camera can sometimes be cumbersome, can be a bit to manipulate around, and sometimes caused me to misclick on things even sometimes swinging the weapon in mid-air at nothing due to a misclick. Aside from this, I don't really think I could find much to complain about when it comes to gameplay, storyline, gameplay mechanics, or anything else. This was $60 well spent. I enjoyed my time in both early access and in the full game and I look forward to continually playing this game over the next bunch of years.

All in all I would say Baldur's Gate 3 is not only one of the greatest role-playing games that I have ever had the fortune of playing, but it is also one of the greatest games I've had the pleasure of play as well as just one of the greatest games of all time. This game is a masterpiece. Larian Studios should be praised for the level of content and the amount of passion you can tell that went into this project. This is truly a benchmark and a high standard for games going forward. The game is a nat 20 on the roll. I couldn't give it higher praise. Totally recommended for one of the best roleplay experiences ever. Thanks Larian for such an amazing game.

Cyberpunk 2077 is beautiful, dystopian, depressing and at times nihilistic.  [/h1]

This is my review for cyberpunk 2077 base game version 2.12:

The game takes place in night city; where your misery is soaked in neon, late stage capitalism is in full effect and crime rate is over the top.
Wherever you go, there are all sorts of ads, whether the holograms contaminating the sky at night, the massive billboards everywhere, or the ads blared through loudspeakers on each and every corner.

Corporations now basically rule the world and they even go on full scale wars in order to eradicate each other.

Without getting into spoilers, the protagonist is on a quest, and they're running out of time, and it is up to you whether they succeed or not. Although, gotta say, night city ain't gonna make it easy for you.

Crime is rampant in night city, and it's so bad that the police has to outsource crime fighting to mercs and whomever is up to the task, as long as they get it done.

Whenever you're cruising, you'll find random shootouts between street gangs, and crimes that need to be stopped, of course you can intervene for some sweet eddies!

Just get ready, cause in night city, you get no happy endings.

[h2] Pros: [/h2]

[olist]
    [*]Good story, as expected from CDPR.
    [*]High quality quests, whether they're main quests or side quests, it's not like your map will be cluttered with copy and paste quests like those you'd get from [i] cough [/i] ubisoft[i] cough [/i].
    [*]Great voice acting, you can tell there was effort being put there with the actors pouring their souls into their voice lines.
    [*][b] Keanu Reeves! [/b], and yes he isn't just there for the sake of it, Johnny Silverhand is a well written character, and even though he's a douche at the beginning, he becomes nicer as you get closer to himm as the story progresses.
    [*]Just like the witcher 3, the world feels lived in.
    [*]Facial animations are realistic, even for the NPCs.
    [*]A variety of play styles, loved playing as a ninja hacker!
    [*]Inventory management; this one game that I didn't have to empty my inventory every few minutes due to items' weight. I'm looking at you, fallout 4 and witcher 3.
    [*]The graphics are a big improvement coming from the witcher 3.
[/olist]

[h2] Cons: [/h2]

[olist]
    [*]Minor annoyances, like not being able to change your car's color (come on), even though you can find different colors and even variants of the same car being driven by NPCs.
    [*]Most cars drive weirdly, kinda slippery, so you'll often run a pedestrian or two, and the next thing you find yourself facing maxtac.
    [*]While the city feels alive, there are lots of shops where you can't interact with the shopkeepers.
    [*]The endings; I got the secret ending, which is supposed to be the [b] good ending [/b], and even that feels bitter sweet at best, although I guess it is kinda open ended. I think CDPR took the ""There are no happy endings in cyberpunk genre"" too seriously.
[/olist]

[h3] Tl; DR: A must play openworld RPG, even though it can be gut wrenching at times.
As for the cons, most of these can be solved by using mods, but this review is for an unmodded playthrough. [/h3]"

2.0 is far better than what we got back in 2020, but still pretty far away from what was promised in various promos and NC Wires etc. I love the world, the atmosphere, the gangs and the various build possibilities with the wide range of cyberware and weaponry at your disposal - I've RPed as Shotaro Kaneda, Johnny Mnemonic and Molly Millions, to name a few.

That said, the open world still feels pretty empty as the side content gets tedious quickly (hustles/gigs/psychos are the same thing over and over) and the districts aren't really THAT different from each other. Badlands.. just boring. Most quests are simply ""go to that location and deal with this enemy"" or just constant talking/following. There's an illusion of choice until you reach the point of no return, but that's literally the ending. Silverhand is an interesting character once you get deeper into the game, but I don't feel he's worth the major overhaul they did to the story to fit him in. I feel Act 1 suffers the most from this, all that build up then nothing. And Keanu's performance is very stale. Sorry, I said it.

Now I'm finally trying out the 2.0 edition. Knowing the basics is great, I'm taking it slow and completing tons of side missions and gigs. I am rich, I can buy people off easily if i don't feel like using a skill check. The driving is supreme, better than GTA I would say. Gunplay and melee mechanics are superb as well, and using quickhacks with a loaded Cyberdeck is some of the most satisfying gameplay loops I've ever experienced. Story 10/10, characters 10/10, worldbuilding 10/10. Probably my favorite RPG since Fallout NV, and it even blows that out of the water for me."

I hope that CD projekt spends more time developing actual gameplay vs infinite Citiscape as QoL updates dont mean anything when your game runs like a single blade push mower
76561197982854475,1623730,True,0.654082894325256348,"GAMEPLAY:
Survival adventure RPG monster taming game. Look out to resources and food to gather. Capture, obtain, or kill pals - cute monsters spread all over around the map - to get resources, gain exp and level up. As you do so, get access to better items and structures that can be built.

Plenty of functional and decorative options to spruce up your base up. Rather large structures can be built, though foundation building can be restrictive in rough and uneven terrain.

I like how pals still drop their items and exp even if you opt to catch them, instead of killing them.

Captured or obtained pals can be used either as partners that can be used in battles, riding, etc., or as slave workers in your base. Or sacriced to improve the stats of another pal, so there is benefit on having dozens of the same one.

Multiplayer access is optional and can also be enabled and disabled at any time. That being said, there is no difficulty scaling, so playing with others may make defeating and/or capturing high level unique pals or bosses, and resources gathering, easier.

Pal AI behaviors do have some issues. For one, pals assigned to work at bases easily get stuck or otherwise refuse to work. Pal assignment to specific tasks is rather tedious, and even if done, pals may not follow through for long. Pals may also easily get hungry, even with abundant and good quality food available.

CUSTOMIZATION:
I love how the game allows for easy customization of many of the game rules, such as catch rate, hunger rate, player and pal dealt and received damage, death penalties, etc. that can be freely modified at anytime throughout the map progression. This can make for a very easy and relaxing game - or the complete opposite.

Unfortunately no Steam Workshop so if one is interested in modding and further game customization. they have to be obtained and manually installed through third party places like Nexus.

WORLD
The map is huge but is static and not randomly generated. Teleport statues make fast travel between very distant locations easy, but given the size of the map travel can still feel slow at times, especially in some of the more advanced islands where such statues are located further apart.

There are Alpha and unique/""legendary"" pals whose locations are clearly indicated in the player map, a nice feature IMO.

Lots of empty areas in the map do exist - i.e. open water - and where additional content might be placed in future updates, but at the moment do not contribute to the game, other than make thee player waste time needlesly exploring the map.

VISUALS
Simply stunning to look at. Plays amazingly in ultrawidescreen 5120x1440. I love the huge rendering distances. Pals do look adorable. I would say something to improve in this area are better costume/armor variety/customization.

STORY/PLOT
Very sparse and needs work. The character controlled are explorers that somehow all end up in the island after a shipwreck. There is some lore spread out throughout the region. 

There are also human factions supposedly trying to exploit the place, and their bosses that can be killed off, but doing so or not adds nothing of value to the story or even to the player, other than exp and achievements, at the moment.

MUSIC/SOUND
Underwhelming and often absent. Some music plays off during pal and boss battles, but otherwise the game is eerily silent.

SUMMARY:
Great combination of Pokemon gotta catch them all and survival base games like ARK or Don't Starve Together, but significantly cuter. It has some issues at the moment but it is in early access and was not released long ago, so I am sure improvements will come in time. Well priced for what it is. 9/10"
76561197998490326,1623730,False,0.558164656162261963,"TL;DR It's a mixed bag right now, especially with bugs. Wait until it's more polished.

There are some good ideas, and parts of the game can be fun.
But there is still a lot that needs more work, and there are a lot of bugs as well, from mildly annoying to incredibly frustrating. In no particular order, and only a selection of issues i've encountered:

- AI Pathfinding is awful, pals and NPCs get stuck constantly
- Assigning pals to specific tasks is simply not doable right now, which makes managing a base very frustrating. on paper you can automate a lot of things, in reality you have to do a lot of things yourself, or constantly micromanage pals. It feels like i'm just doing chores instead of doing fun things i want to do a lot of the time.
- auto aim ""feature"" that actually makes attacks miss a lot, and can't find a setting to disable it
- Bad UI - some screens take several Esc presses to get out of, i often have to click through various menus to get to the information i want (why is info on habitats of pals not accessible from the context detailed info screen, or at least a link to the paldex? There is no search function in the paldex either, so if you want to look up info on a pal....you have to scroll through the whole list to find it). In short, it's very frustrating how much work it is to make the game do what you want, or get the information you want and it feels like you have to fight the UI
- Bugs: Crashing, performance drops, getting stuck in terrain - it's pretty buggy, and not in a charming way
- Mod support, which is good - at the same time, mods often don't work or cause crashes, and error messages are not very helpful
- Raids on your bases can be ridiculously overpowered - got around level 30 enemies attacking while at level 15 or so
- riding pals sounds great in theory, in practice you shouldn't ride pals in combat because attacks will also hit you, and you will die very fast. It's just sad that riding pals is disencouraged in that way. And related...
- armor breaks extremely quickly, and is expensive to repair
- Sensory overloading - if you're sensitive to flashing and the like, expect a rough time. Mining animations are very flashy, mining at night in particular is awful with very dark background and then huge bright flashes. Personally i avoid mining at night altogether, there are no settings to disable this either; could use more thought on accessibility.

I could go on. It is playable. And yes it can be fun. But it definitely feels like early access and is often frustrating, and you'll do yourself a favour by waiting some more time so the devs can hopefully polish the game up and make it a smoother experience. The foundation for a good game is absolutely there, and i hope it'll get there in a year or two."

The existence of the (player) Attack stat.

If you don't spec into it, you'll feel really weak fighting bosses at endgame. Your bullets do single digits worth of damage, and against bosses with tens of thousands of HP, that doesn't feel good. Conversely, if you do spec into it, bosses become really easy. Get 5 'mons with the Vanguard trait (Bonus if they're Gobfins) and 40-50 levels spent on Attack Up, and you'll shred bosses.

However, the game's reputation system has turned it into a cesspool of toxicity and frustration. The system is absolutely trash, with players being unfairly punished for minor infractions or even false reports.

The game's community has also been destroyed by the constant changes and updates over the years. What was once a balanced and enjoyable experience has devolved into a mess of overpowered operators, game-breaking bugs, and unbalanced maps. Ubisoft's insistence on catering to the casual players has alienated competitive scene, leading to a dwindling player base and longer queue times.

Overall, Rainbow Six Siege is a shadow of its former self. The reputation system is a joke, and the constant updates have driven away the very community that made the game great. Unless Ubisoft makes some serious changes, the game is doomed to fade into obscurity. Save your money and avoid this train wreck of a game at all costs."

What I saw in the first 1.5 hours of the Steam 2 hour ""grace period"" was very underwhelming for one specific odd reason (which if it's something you also look for in survival games -- you might want to pass on this one): 

The game's ""huge open world"" doesn't feel like it's continuous ""open space"". It instead feels weirdly confined and disjointed, to the point where being ""outdoors"" doesn't feel like being outside, and instead just feels like being in a large ""room"" with a dozen trees in it. The whole space seems to be subdivided into squares of 100x100m, and then every 100x100m square is stuffed with 3-4 ""points of interest"", so that you cannot walk for 30 seconds without bumping into something ""interesting"". The small starting area is so crowded with ""tHinGs To dO anD eXpLoRe"", that it doesn't feel ""real"", and instead feels more like a children's playground. This shortage of ""horizontality"" is compounded by overabundance of ""verticality"" (every 100 meters you run into another 50m high cliff -- which serves as the boundary for the ""room""), all of which adds to the feeling of claustrophobia, like you're in the ""Cube"" movie: leaving one enclosed area, only to find yourself in the next one.

[b]NOTE: I don't know if further out it gets better, at that point I ran (refunded) while I still could.[/b]

To understand what I'm talking about, look at gameplay videos and pay attention to how at any given point in time there is never a continuous space longer than ~30-50 meters. After that there is either a hill, a cliff, a shroud area, a POI, etc. 

As long as that works for you, and feels like ""lots of stuff to explore"" -- then you'll be fine. For me unfortunately it feels immersion-breaking  and borderline creepy."

76561198024474720,1203620,True,0.523809552192687988,"This is the b est new game I've played since Valhiem was released. I've got a little over 150 hours on my first play-through, and just completing end game POI's and quests. While the game utilizes a lot of elements that helped make other titles successful, one unique element is the shroud, which is a heavy fog bank in the bottom of valleys and players are restricted to how much time they are in the shroud before returning to a normal area. The shroud effectively hide the valley so that you do not know when your walking into. Visibility is limited in the fog which make the surrounding mobs and hostile environment very dangerous for those who are not cautious.

Crafting
Everything in the game is destructible and breaks down to usable resources. Those resources can be combines to make everything you'll need to survive. Most crafting is done with the help of 5 npc artisans you must rescue; blacksmith, hunter, carpenter, farmer, and alchemist. Once rescued you can place these npc's in your base where each acts as a specialized crafting station. The alchemist makes potions and spell charges, the hunter make arrows and other things you might expect from a hunter, etc.

Cooking
There is water and a lot of food options available. You don't need food and drink to survive. It works similar to Valhhiem in that each item provides powerful buffs that wear out over time. Many plants you harvest in game can be be cultivated and famed. 

Base Building
This is where the devs shine. The building system is now officially my favorite surpassing Valhiem and Conan. There are three sizes of blocks; 1, 2 and 4 meters. However the distinction is that all building blocks are constructed of the smallest 1 meter components. So, when you place a 4 meter wall section, you can then use the edit tool to delete 1 meter block out of the wall, essentially cutting your windows and door out of the wall with what ever size, position, ans shape you desire. There is no structural integrity, so you are free to be as creative as your mind can be. Additionally, there are currently 31 different building set textures from rough wood to polished stone, to metal. 

Travel
Part of the games challenge and enjoyment comes from the difficulty of traversing the dangerous environment. Almost everything in the shroud want to kill you. Fortunately the devs have provided the ability to teleport to special spires you must discover first. Also you may teleport to any base flame shine you have placed, and you can have a maximum of eight flame shrines. So, you might spend two days finding a path into an area, killing things along the way, but when you find that spire, you have an easy way to get back. Another unique game element not real common in other games is the ability to build a glider. You may teleport to the top of a spire once you have solved all the puzzles to get to the top. From there you have a lot of elevation from which to glide to other location.  Gliding is a blast and a quick method of getting around, and the end game gliders let you cover 1/4 of the map in one glide. There are a lot of elevations in terrain to provide opportunities to use your glider. Take care when gliding into the shroud though. Visibility is very poor so you may not know what your flying into. You may just encounter a sheer wall that you can't go over or get around, and a lake of lava at the base of the wall. Fortunately when you die and drop part of your inventory which has a brightly lit death marker, that marker is placed where you jumped from not where you died. So, don't worry about leaving a death marker at the bottom of a deep pit or the middle of a lake of lava, your marker is placed at the top where you were last on solid ground.

Summary
I can't recommend this game enough. As of this writing it's on sale for 10% off. It's well worth full price. You will not be disappointed. There are very few bugs for an early access game aside from a few mobs stuck in the ground the game is very clean and polished. Keen has a very active discord channel, though I have had no need of support so far."

76561198341489088,1203620,True,0.523809552192687988,"I was not impressed when the game offered a couple of hours free trial. At that point the game had crashes and you cant really do much in a couple of hours. Now when it came out in early access i thought that I will try it out once more. And oh, I was not dissapointed at all. Once you break a couple of first hours in game, a new horizon apears and the game gets much more better. I dont know how did I get 62h allready and I have not unocked the endgame gear. You can easily strech a playthrough and get far more time out of it. I think I have rushed through it because I wanted to unlock new build peaces ASAP.

I can break down some key points that I have  noticed:

1. Combat and movement is smooth. Like it. But had to adjust to it, did not like it at start.
2. Combat ballance is in early stages. If you want a challenge, try building a hybrid build or dont use skill points. Otherwise use staff and oneshot everything. :D 
3. The building is phenomenal. If you like building games, this will be it. You dont think of buildings as of seperate lego peaces, but as a mold. You can sculpt and carve. Its amazing. The buildings have no structural integrity like in Valheim, and peaces dont have to touch ground. You can really build anything as long as its in the range of your altar. Only thing I would love is to rotate build 45degrees.
4. The crafing is great, has depth in it. But I dont like that some things are not comming in the right order. For example water station in your base is available only in end game. Water should be easier to acquire than honey.  Also you can convert sugar into honey, but sugar gives you more boost, then why even convert? And please, if i have water in my base, dont ask me to gather it from the well.
5. You can chease the enshrouded mechanic and respawn chests jsut by going to main menu and reloading save(Offline). Dont do it!
6. Teraforming is amazing. You can dig caves.
7. You are fighting the same mobs all game, except for the wildlife that changes in each biome.
8. You can snatch a village from mobs and use it as your base. If you get a furnished tavern, you get 30min rested bonus from it. Renovate it and its good to go.
9 There is no procedurally generated world. It limits the replay-ability. The world is filled with a lot of things but feels a bit repetetive.
10. Feels bad to die because you accedentally glided in the red pond in shrouded area and have to go throught two loading screens to get rested buff again. You should always respawn in base in my opinion. The flame globes should be interactable that give you buff for respawn.

PS. Forgot to mention. Good luck fighting mobs that are flying while you are speced as melee. :D"

Seems like if you avoid going into the Shroud, you could just live in a cozy house and forget about it all. Needs the Shroud to send out enemies like Plague Hearts in 'State of Decay 2' to keep you on your toes. 

Graphically it's nice but nothing special. Sound design is lacklustre. When starting 'Valheim', you're chucked into a lighting storm and have to rush to fend for yourself while trees creak, rain crackles and thunder booms. In 'Enshrouded'... it's just a nice, calm day. 

I'll keep an eye on this but at this point, it's average. Very basic and desperately needs some art and sound FLAIR to lift it above the crowd."

The story is great if pieced together through bits and pieces, especially those NPC questlines which can be a real head scratcher to get through, if not downright impossible without looking up a guide. Yet, after having completed all those quests, the storylines are great and the lore feels in-depth and has weight to it. The combat felt great, having a great collection of weapon arts, sorceries and incantations, that I had tons of fun using. Graphically, the game is stunning yet my low end GPU can still run it on high settings, thank you to FromSoft for that. There aren't many negatives. The story never once felt dragged on, and each character's motivations felt meaningful and strong. The only thing might be, as I mentioned earlier, confusing optional quests. 
I'd give this game a 9.5/10 and I'd highly recommend it to everyone, especially those who have never delved into any Souls games before. This might be a great introductory game into the world of Souls, as it certainly was for me. Looking forward to 'Shadow of the Erdtree'!

- Injuries sustained realistically affect player's movement/action/shooting
- Tactical thinking comes in handy most timers
- No micro-transactions, no P2W
- Multiplayer progress doesn't count for personal progress
- Nice easter eggs in the Evidence Room

Now, about the Cons (nothing unfixable or game breaking):
- Maps are too cluttered (especially HQ) sometimes collision/hotboxes are buggy
- Devs use AI generated artwork!?
- GFX and VFX need more optimization to avoid random FPS drop and stuttering at times
- Aiming is inaccurate, hjit registry is glitchy and way off at times
- Getting hit disorients you rending you almost impossible to return fire
- Movement is awkward at times (not super smooth) and being unable to sprint is frustrating especially in HQ
- Enemy Bots can wall-bang you and have 0 tactical thinking
- AI teammates can body-block you in small rooms or hallways, very inconsistent and sometimes irresponsible to commands
- No unique NPC traits, all Suspects are similarly suicidal and all Victims are extremely passive
- Restraining Suspects/Citizens is buggy, slow, and ignores collision which looks kinda off
- Arabic Voice-lines/Text is a big FAIL. Nobody speaks MSA (Modern Standard Arabic), it's like speaking old-English...
- Multiple hotkeys overlap (assigning an already used hotkey keeps both hotkeys simultaneously)
- No way to track mission progress except for replaying and triggering the summary page at the end of a mission (In an effort to list the mission still needed for the ""Medal of Valor"" achievement [S-rank all] I had to look up a list of evidence and double check them across 3 different gameplays in order to shortlist the remaining missions.
- 10 seconds countdown is useless in Single Player mode
- Re-playability is questionable...

In a nutshell, this game is good but tbh, It doesn't feel like a Dec-2023-released game; it has a great potential if re-hauled and hotfixed regularly."

My only issue is 2 achievements are bugged, and can't be obtained through normal means. GUMSHOE and INTERIOR DESIGNER fail to pop under normal circumstances, and the recent patch didn't do anything to fix this.

[b]At the time of this review (2024-03-16), you've already missed out on [u]17 Battle Passes[/u] in a Play-to-Play and Pay-to-Win game.[/b] 

Behaviour Interactive Inc. is both the Developer and the Publisher. [b]Through psychological manipulation strategies, such as threats of deprivation, they demonstrate a lack of respect for their player base.[/b] And they are free from a Publisher strong-arming them into this decision. 

After browsing the game I saw Tome #18 (Battle Pass). [b]Other players confirmed Tome items are made inaccessible after the next Tome is released[/b]. Unable to be purchased/unlocked later If you don't play and pay when/how they dictate. You are simply [b]locked out forever,[/b] and with Battle Passes you lose access to obtaining items, [b]even if you did pay[/b]. 

[b]This isn't a Free-to-Play game[/b] either, so that justification is missing. [b]Halo Infinite is Free-to-Play, and you can purchase/progress their Battle Passes [u]at any time[/u][/b]. In Halo Infinite the only thing you lose access to is the opportunity to progress the Free Track without acquiring the Premium Track. 

[b]As you have to purchase Characters on top of the base game (who come with unique abilities) this game is also effectively [u]Pay-to-Win[/u][/b]. 

To get the complete experience with this game, you need to: 
[list]
[*]Purchase the [b]Base Game[/b]
[*]Purchase all [b]Characters[/b] and [b]Maps[/b]
[*][b]Every Battle Pass in [u]perpetuity[/u][/b] (and complete them within their season to avoid losing access to items regardless of payment)[b]*[/b]
[*][b]Dedicate several hours to watching eligible channels on Twitch[/b] for exclusive items on short notice (which is an attempt to control what you do and consume outside of the game)[b]*[/b]
[/list] 
[i][b]*[/b]The last 2 points are impossible to complete for newcomers, and Twitch is known for having bugs that prevent completion requirements.[/i]

It seems the decision makers would rather attempt to control their consumer base, rather than show them respect and demonstrate confidence in their product. 

Unfortunately, I can only advocate against Dead by Daylight and Behaviour Interactive Inc.'s practices, and [b]I have had this game refunded[/b]."

As an early access game I have high hopes for the future development and updates for the game, there are a few bugs as of current; the most notable of which being that customers will pick up items and get stuck in a loop of searching endlessly, causing you to lose products at the end of the day as a result as they put it in there bags and despawn at the end of the day.

The game is looking promising aside from that, with an addictive cycle, ever-expanding your store and marking up products to incentive profits. If you are easily frustrated at bugs, I would seriously consider waiting until future developments and updates are put into the game before purchasing, as many features are currently not implemented, such as settings, sound options etc."

Whether you're restocking shelves, scanning items at the checkout, or managing inventory, every aspect of running a supermarket is meticulously simulated, providing a sense of immersion that's second to none.

But what truly sets Supermarket Simulator apart is its ability to effortlessly blend entertainment with education. While you're busy navigating the aisles and keeping track of inventory, you'll find yourself sharpening your math skills without even realizing it. From mental arithmetic to strategic budgeting, Supermarket Simulator offers a crash course in mathematics that's as effective as it is enjoyable. Customer hands me a $100 bill for a $3.72 item? No problem. And also, get out.

And let's not forget the sheer relaxation that comes with playing Supermarket Simulator. There's something oddly soothing about organizing shelves, ringing up purchases, and keeping the store running smoothly. It's the perfect game to unwind with after a long day or to simply let time pass by in a stress-free environment.

76561198001506823,1462040,True,0.54356849193572998,"This is my favorite iteration of Final Fantasy VII thus far. I much prefer this over the original. The years haven't really been kind to the original in my eyes and this shows how far we've come since then. The storytelling and pacing in this game is very good, as I've come to expect from Square Enix at this point in time. If you ignore side quests, the main story has great pacing and the characters have good character development. There are a couple sections in the game that drag a little, but overall, it doesn't drag down the experience.

I do like the combat in this game quite a bit. It may not be like the original game, but I enjoy the action combat that has become the norm for recent Final Fantasy games. It's executed well here, allowing for multiple playstyles to shine as well as for mastery to exist. Each character has a very distinct moveset and playstyle that can be molded further with personal customizations via the materia and weapon upgrade system. Mastery of the system can allow for very powerful combinations. I will say that there is a difficulty spike nearing end-game. Sometimes, I found myself in situations where I would just be juggled to death without the ability to defend myself. It is rare. So perhaps I just got unlucky.

Overall, the package is great. It is way up my list of favorite games of all time. I'd highly recommend this if you're new to Final Fantasy VII. If you're a fan of the old game, don't expect the old game coming into this as you'll be very disappointed."

Given the game has been out 2 years with only 2 minor patches, I'm giving it negative score. Seems they just jumped into making the next games and abandoned supporting this properly.

This hits the sweet spot for me between Diablo 4 and Path of Exile.  It has depth but doesn't require you to get builds from the internet or third party software.  Obviously if you're a min/maxer there is depth between the individual skill tree and passive skill trees.

Some highlights for me are
-built in loot filter (really easy to figure out yourself or import community filters)
-ability skill trees (these points really modify the base ability and makes each point impactful)
-Crafting(the rng with the forging potential and sealing can feel bad sometimes, but that just makes when you hit feel that much better)

Cons
-Endgame is fine (comparing this to something like poe doesn't feel fair against a game with 10 years of dev though right now)
-You can't skip the campaign at all (leveling alts is a bit slow, but you can use some leveling gear you're picked up on your main"
76561197970564487,899770,True,0.525547444820404053,"I finished the main story of this last night, and I‚Äôd have to say this is a pretty impressive game but with a few caveats. None of these detract from, ‚ÄúI think you should buy it,‚Äù but might be wait-for-a-sale indicators depending on your personal stance üôÇ

TL;DR: if you like games with true build diversity and a lot of fun factor, you‚Äôll dig this. Caution should be exercised if you don‚Äôt like more difficult ARPGs and/or ones with a focus on holistic toon design.

First up, while this is an ARPG, it feels more spiritually connected to Path of Exile (PoE) than Diablo. This is partially the vibe and art style, where PoE set itself off as a pretty outstanding successor to Diablo II that (IMO) Blizzard have yet to beat with their attempts (even with D4). But it‚Äôs also to do with how deeply thought through the skill and build system is, but without the nightmarish complexity of PoE.

The way they achieve this diversity-but-simplicity is through the subclass system. Let‚Äôs say you pick the Acolyte class; this is basically the ‚Äúbad wizard‚Äù choice. You get all kinds of rad skills like making bones explode from your chest to ruin your enemies, but once you hit around level 20, you get to pick a subclass - in this case, Necromancer, Warlock, and and Lich. You keep the main skill tree of Acolyte, but get a secondary skill tree (and unique spells) for your subclass. This means your build is channeled into something quite diverse yet without the daunting star chart of PoE. Arguably it‚Äôs PoE‚Äôs star chart that drives more cookie cutter builds, but the Last Epoch system provides true diversity by restricting choice paralysis and encouraging experimentation through a relatively low-cost respec system.

Compared to D4, where the base game is built on mobs being damage sponges driving absolute focus on pure DPS, it‚Äôs quite refreshing to find a game system that is linked to true build diversity.

So, that‚Äôs all good - is there a bad side to this? There sure is, and this is in the form of how itemisation works. There are a couple bosses in the game that are 100% gear checks. The ones driving absolute rage online appear to be Majasa and Lagon, who I can confirm are not a fun time ü§£ The reason they drive rage is because you can tune your build and gear to work for 99.999% of the game, then you‚Äôll hit these guys and they will clean your clock due to how gearing and resistances work. In Majasa‚Äôs case, you need a lot of physical resistance; Lagon requires ice and lightning. If you don‚Äôt have the RNGesus on your side to give you these items, you will be having a rough time, faced with either grinding out some equipment or facing down the barrel of the Forging system (crafting).

The online debate about the ease of these bosses (outside the neckbearders who just say ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù) is definitely around gearing, and whether you can grind your way there - so while we have good build diversity, the build is a complete whole, including gear, and this might not appeal to people who don‚Äôt want to grind or craft the right stuff.

Now, some more good: the gameplay is pure gold. I think this game is one of the best distillations of a design ethos where each class feels different to play and will appeal to different people. I played a mage in early access, and rolled through a Falconeer (Ranger) and Warlock (Acolyte) in release, and all are pretty different experiences (while still being powerful). You can structure each character around an idea. Want to be a melee-based Ranger with a Falcon? You do you, bro. Want to be the dark sorceress the world should fear? Got you covered. The click:joy ratio is very high, and feels far closer to the high speed rampages of PoE or Victor Vran, or late-game D3, than much else out there. 

Spectacle wise, this game gets the job done. The visual downside would be the models, which aren‚Äôt too high detail, but the visual effects and sound stage are S tier. If you warp to an enemy and detonate your body, murdering them in a shower of blood, you will feel that through your sub. Lightning crackles. Etc. The music is great, providing the right ambience at the right times."

76561198044649830,899770,False,0.523236691951751709,Another case of devs being rushed and an unfinished product being launched. It's comparable to POE in many aspects so if you want a lighter version of that then this game is perfect but it's so full of bugs and broken abilities you may be better off waiting a year or two for the game to get some polish and some end game content.
76561198100466054,899770,True,0.522968173027038574,"I am a huge fan of ARPGs. The Butcher from Diablo 1 was my first video game scare, and the adrenaline rush that followed got 10 year old me hooked on aarpgs. Since then I grew up with arpgs and have played Diablo 2 and its expansion extensively, path of exile, diablo 3, and diablo 4. Grim Dawn is next on my list (I have a backlog).  I am more of a casual console player now a days since most of my free time is taken up by life. I heard about this game while playing Diablo 4, and as an avid aarpg fan, I had to try it out!

The game overall is great! The standout features are the crafting and character building. The ability to use the forge to customize your affixes and prefixes on your items is well done and give players a lot of freedom to tailor their items to their character build. I LOVE the character growth and building in this game. The game allows you to grow your character through an interesting talent tree that includes specializations that can be unlocked, which is standard for most rpgs and aprgs. What really caught my eye was the ability to level up your skills separate from your character class tree. The amount of customization with just skill growth was impressive. You can change elements of spells, how they function, crit modifiers, etc. all to help play your character the way you want to play it. The only frustrating part regarding character builds and talents was only superficial. You cannot change or edit your avatar, and are stuck with the pregenerated looks of your character, which is pretty staple for aarpgs in my experience. It would be nice to design your toon to look the way you want. Thank goodness for the diversity of builds in this game since it helps offset the inability to customize your toon with being able to have a lot of control with your character build to help make your toon unique with how you want to play the game. 

What didn't stand out was the more generic storyline, creature / monster design, and atmosphere. The storyline has a lot to do with time travel, and of course the generic corrupting Darkness (in this game Void) as the enemy. The characters are very flat and the voice acting just isn't there. There is potential with seeing how characters play out in different timelines but I won't spoil any of the mainstory. I am not compelled to continue playing this game for the story or the characters and started skipping most of the story beats after act 3. If it wasn't for the character building, item chase, and gameplay I would've put it down. This is more of a testament to how well done the game systems are. You can ignore the story and have a blast! The story isn't bad persay, just very generic. Also I found the atmosphere very conflicting with the game narrative. Colors seem too bright and cheery for how dark the plot is and doesn't mesh well. Music is alright, and very generic as well. 

This game is not perfect though. Some parts I did not enjoy were annoyances that can be solved with bug fixes. However there is an issue with dungeons I do not enjoy. The most frustrating bugs will crash your game, but one in particular will delete items you leave on the ground out in the field when you return to town. Many arpgers are familiar with returning to town to sell off any extra items when they find their bags are full. When the return back from town the expectation are the items they were not able to pick up before would still be there. In this game they are deleted if you do not pick them up before you head to town, which is frankly very annoying. The other annoyance is regarding dungeons. 

Dungeons show up in the game after act 2 I believe. In order to access them keys will drop from enemies and chests that will allow you to unlock a dungeon run. What isn't communicated is once you use that key for a dungeon run you cannot leave the dungeon for any reason without it resetting. If you have to portal back to town while you are in the dungeon for any reason, including selling items and making room in your stash, you will lose access to the dungeon and your key will be gone, forcing you to farm for another key and do the dungeon again. If you die while doing the dungeon, same thing. The dying causing dungeons to reset and losing a key I am not so upset about. In fact I do like the mechanic of dying resetting the dungeon, that makes sense, and the dark souls masochist in me loves it, but being penalized cause you needed to portal to use the restroom, or answer a call, or simply sell loot to make room for more is very frustrating, especially in a loot driven game. Why limit our looting in a dungeon in an aarpg? 

The endgame is a little bare bones but it is expected with a new aarpgs. It is in a much better state than most aarpgs when they are first released though, with clear goals and activities as well as excellent rewards as an incentive. I dont want to spoil the mainstory, but towards the end you will be dealing with timelines. As you complete timelines you will unlock permanent passives that will strengthen your character. There is also the dungeons that I mentioned, an arena mode that reminds me of Horde mode from Gears of War or Firefight from ODST, and farming bosses of course. The gameplay is so much fun its a pleasure to engage in these kinds of endgame activity. I am sure there are more systems on the way and am looking forward to playing them as they are released!

With all that said I highly recommend this game. Personally it is a solid 8/10 for me. The gameplay, the character building, and the item crafting are what makes this game stand out. The atmosphere and storytelling are very generic though. The game play will carry you past that. If you are a fan of ARPGs, espcially isometric ones, this is a must buy. I look forward to getting the console release so I can sit back and play on a bigger screen. THANK YOU ELEVENTH HOUR GAMES! THIS GAME IS SO MUCH FUN!!"
76561198013882260,899770,False,0.520085453987121582,"it's a low budget Arpg. very repetitive. the map resets the mobs after a short time of leaving a area that you are still exploring on. mobs reset after using your personal portal too. the music is on a loop. but the rest is ok. many characters and classes to pick through skills and modifications to those skills. loot, lots of loot I didn't make it that far and may never will.

The bad: 
Quality control issues all over the place

- Game doesn't feel like a labour of love from the Devs like at all because attention to detail is not there with Inconsistent quality of textures, animations, SFX and VFX, voice quality, etc. - how do they approve it for release? There is literally typos with HTML5 <br> code in Character screen (I guess they need another 5 years in EA to fix those), for example, and complete mess with texture quality all over the place

- For a new player myself, 1.0 ""release"" feels like nothing more than just a pure marketing 

-  Graphics with bad (for my taste) stylizing (especially bad at Ancient Era) and lack of the unique look

- Lackluster bosses

- Why I need to click additional button to collect resources in my inventory?

- Why resources doesn't stack in inventory?

- Why keys doesn't stack and doesn't have similar to resources inventory space?

- I found unique green ""Bear"" looking set and on my character model it looks like... standard armour?.. I understand they need to make money from skins, but not like this

- Still riddled with bugs (and there is a lot of them, all types of), typos (literally HTML5 <br> code in text), and connectivity issues (everyone ""sliding"" in cities, and it's nearly month after ""release"" ? Is this a joke?)

- Campaign is also total boredom and snooze fest. There is nothing interesting happening either, you just go from point A to point B. No in-engine-game cinematics, no spectacle action, dungeons with interesting mechanics, etc - literally nothing memorable. Just point A to B with forgettable characters and voice acting. Who approved this?

- Maps are boring, flat, offer no verticality or spectacle action, and most of the time there is not enough monsters to kill on them. Almost no secrets and no reason to explore the maps. Time travel is not utilized enough

- Chat settings default to ""Public"" channel every, damn, time, you enter the game and you only can disable the chat entirely so that doesn't happen, OR, manually leave ""Public"" channel every time. Who designed this, tested, and leaved it in-game for 5+ years?

- Itemization is off. Why is lvl 0-5-10-15-20 white, green, blue, rare swords, axes, staffs, etc. dropping for my 38 lvl character??? For what? I made loot filter for those but question still here


The good:
- At least gameplay is not bad (and not great either, it's passable) and it's the only saving grace for this game are the gameplay mechanics like crafting and build variety.

I'm astonished at the fact that this mediocre game is so popular"

What I love most about this game is that you don't have to spend all your time on a third party website looking at a build guide or trading. Everything is basically self explanatory and easy to understand. The in game guide does a good job of explaining every mechanic. The graphics updates from the beta look amazing and I'm sure this game is only going to get better. The synergy between skills in this game is well explained in the skill trees and every skill has it's own tree so there are literally hundreds of builds you can make that are viable.

as a new to MH kind of game player, its not very intuitive and takes abit to get a hang of. the amount of walking is pretty unnecessary as well for the lack of open work interactions. even in town to walk to a required NPC, go to your room, text weapons, it takes too long. 5 hours in and I found quests to be rather repetitive. for $7 during sale its fine, but i wont pay the 23 bucks (sale) for the expansions (which i already did and cant refund since the game has been on for 5 hours)."

76561199097389095,1966720,True,0.545454561710357666,"Elon Musk life story begins in South Africa, where he was born. Later, he went on to become an American entrepreneur who co-founded PayPal and established SpaceX, a launch vehicle and spacecraft manufacturer. He was also one of the original major investors in and the CEO of Tesla, an electric car company.

Elon Reeve Musk is the eldest of his parents' three children, and a citizen of three countries: South Africa, Canada, and the United States. He was born in 1971 to Maye Musk, a model and nutritionist, and Errol Musk, an electromechanical engineer whom Elon has described as ""a dreadful human being."" Musk was born in Canada to a Canadian mother and a South African father. Musk grew up with his head stuck in books and computers. He was bullied by his classmates and often beaten up by class bullies as a little, timid youngster until he grew strong enough to defend himself during a growth spurt in his teens. He developed a video game at the age of 12 and sold it to a computer magazine. Musk left South Africa in 1988 after getting a Canadian passport because he refused to support apartheid through compulsory military duty and wanted to pursue the higher economic prospects offered in the United States.Musk travelled to Canada at the age of 17 to attend Queen's University and evade military service in South Africa. Musk got his Canadian citizenship the same year, partly because he thought it would be easier to get American citizenship that way. Musk moved to the United States in 1992 to study business and physics at the University of Pennsylvania. He earned an undergraduate degree in economics before continuing on to earn a second bachelor's degree in physics. Musk went to Stanford University in California to earn a Ph.D. in energy physics after leaving Penn. But that Ph.D couldn‚Äôt make it to Elon Musk Degrees since he walked out of Stanford after only two days to start his first firm. Musk joined engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning to help operate Tesla Motors in 2004, where he played a key role in the development of the world's first electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster. Musk took over as CEO and product architect after Eberhard was fired from the company in 2007 due to a series of conflicts. Tesla has grown to be one of the most popular and desirable vehicle brands in the world under his leadership.

Elon Musk's SpaceX has signed many high-profile contracts with NASA and the US Air Force to manufacture rockets and execute military missions. Musk has been vocal about his desire to work with NASA on a collaborative mission to deploy an astronaut to Mars by 2025. Elon Musk has always been a proponent of various space-age technologies, but it hasn't always been a smooth journey for him. He went on to become a small business owner and eventually the CEO of two creative firms after being bullied in school. But he made the decision to ascend from there and never settle for anything less.

Tesla, in addition to creating electric automobiles, has a strong presence in the solar energy sector, courtesy to its purchase of SolarCity. This clean-energy services company, which was founded in 2006, now develops two rechargeable solar batteries that are primarily used for stationary energy storage. The Powerwall is designed for residential backup power and off-grid use, whereas the Powerpack is designed for business or electric utility grid use. Elon Musk has shown entrepreneurial inclinations since he was a child. His Engineer father and Dietician mother, who recognised and encouraged his son's passion in technology, accepted him warmly. He got his first computer when he was ten years old and taught himself how to programme. At the age of 12, the young boy built a fully playable video game called ""Blastar,"" which he allegedly sold for ÔºÑ500. Elon Musk attended Pretoria Boys High School and graduated in 1988. To avoid South Africa's obligatory military duty, he went to Canada in 1989 and enrolled at Queen's University in Ontario. He only stayed at the University of Pretoria for five months after that. Musk went on to the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business to earn a bachelor's degree in economics. He also left after two days to pursue his entrepreneurial ambitions after being accepted into the University of Stanford's Physics Graduate Program. As we learn about Elon Musk biography, we understand that he has pursued goals that have motivated not only himself, but also the team of people he has engaged to work with him. Whether it's interplanetary space flight or electric vehicles, these objectives are all geared toward the future and dramatically improving existing conditions.

(well most of it was waiting for people to join the match to be honest) 

Lets talk design - Simple concept and well designed game loop. Deploy, collect, sell and survive. Tried and tested formula always works. But the additional systems and meme worthy enemy design makes the game hilarious and unexpected. 
Yeah you can dodge the bracken but wait, sometimes it just doesn't work the way it should... booyah.

A pro tip: Don't try to understand the game, the more you understand the game the faster the life of the game reduces for you. Play it like a meme as it is.

The best thing in the game is the proximity chat. For the love of god please don't mute if you playing this game, that's half of the fun man.

Jump in with 3 friends and explore to find scrap. Get that scrap back to your ship and meet your quota or else. The higher the quota the more risks you'll take to meet it. The more you explore the more terrifying things you will come across. 

Manage taking flashlights and walkie talkies with you to communicate with your friends or go in without it with the hopes to use those inventory slots to bring out more loot.

This is the type of game that will give you memories that make you think back on that one time something terrifying or funny happened. Like the time I was alone, fleeing from a spider and some other monstrosity while yelling into my walkie talkie for help. I run up a stair case and felt a great sense of relief seeing one of my friends. I ran up to him only for him to turn around and realized he was wearing a strange mask. I died.

Parenthood and the cats/dogs pack with my first pet added a lil bit more complexity and fun insanity to aging up my sims. At about 390 hrs in I bought vampires and werewolves. They added another layer of complexity to manage. 

All in all the base game can get boring after a generation or so on normal lifespan. Long lifespan keeps the sims happier about how long someone has lived but they still get sad and wish it could be longer. I am now at 421 hrs of play and have just started vampire sims. 

I have done werewolf sims and enjoyed the chaos that can happen on full moons and when fury gets high. I have multiple generations of one family and am enjoying seeing where it goes.

My thoughts are that the game doesn't really get fun til you start more than one family on the same save, which I recently learned at about the 366 hr mark of time played. Also most of the fun for me has come from DLC's that i have purchased.

If you want a simple occasional play that can still be crazy depending on what you do with your sims the base game is fine. If you want something more complex and generational intertwined then get the parenthood DLC, because it gives you game play with infant and toddler stages of growing up instead of the base newborn straight to toddler iirc that the base game does. If you want something more supernatural and complex, which I'm still learning, then get the vampires and werewolves DLC's. If you want your sim to have pets like a cat or a dog then get cats and dogs as well as the my first pet DLC's. 

The possiblities with this game are literally endless its just a matter of how much time and money you want to invest in it. Time=lifespans and money= DLC's which the DLC's portion i would suggest waiting for sales to get because it can get expensive to get them all but it is well worth the money investment in my opinion.

76561199097529689,1222670,False,0.523809552192687988,"While this has an extremely smooth build-mode, the game is mostly unplayable.

New content is being favoured over bug fixes as EA uses a predatory FOMO to promote its packs, encouraging players to sign up for email notifications and pushing ads for packs on the start screen and in-game. This game skews towards a younger audience more than previous instalments which should concern parents as exposing children to these marketing tactics is particularly nasty. Despite being riddled with bugs, there has been talk of AI being used for bug fixes and a culture of testers being encouraged not to report bugs that could push back DLC release dates. Devs have also been given public platforms, causing them to deal with hate and negativity from players that ought to be directed through proper channels to protect workers.

Below is a summary of my experience with the game:

- This is by far my most played game because of the build mode alone. The controls and graphics for build mode are attractive and the swatches for furniture allow for even extremely colour-ignorant people like myself to make good looking builds. Even so, in 2024, I would not recommend this as an architecture simulator as the player is limited by excessively strict snapping that cannot be disabled even with cheats designed to allow for greater freedom and by the lack of a colour wheel. Persistent problems also exist with the deletion of terrain paints and deformed terrain around platforms and curved walls which, like diagonal walls, were implemented without sufficient support for objects to function with, these bugs have existed since the release of these features. The worlds are often largely unchangeable set-dressing that makes a custom building seem like an eyesore unless it is matched to the world's given style.

- The art style of sims is frustrating as the clay-like texture and cartoonish expressions distort what would otherwise be human looking features. Even when trying to make a sim based on a real person, it is nearly impossible to get a clear resemblance due to the over-exaggerated animation. Customisation is deceptively limited as there are no colour wheels, clothing basics (such as high-rise trousers) are missing, the fit of clothing is extremely poor when adapting to a sim's body shape, and, while passing efforts have been made to include options for a variety of people, these are often added to the game and then dropped. Due to pressure from players, more pronoun options, varied skin tones, and afro-texture hairstyles were added, however, pronoun implementation is often ungrammatical in game, genetics don't function correctly with skin tones, curly hair textures are still lacking, and fat and muscle distribution is unrealistic with poor textures.

- Gameplay is my least used part of the game. Once again, features that have been added have caused bugs that go unaddressed and fleshed-out content (that is also bug infested) is often locked behind DLC. As a life simulator it is unsatisfying that the game centres around dollhouse-style gamplay, with uninteresting worlds that feel devoid of life due to the amount of set dressing and the amount of sims that spawn randomly rather than having an in-game home. The same NPCs live forever, simulation lag is persistent, and sims are over animated. The progression of relationships is extremely fast which causes social connections to feel worthless rather than achieved. Emotions shown in the corner are extremely distracting and often prohibit player actions. Autonomy is bugged and sims disappear off to do things the second an action isn't queued, causing gameplay to feel rushed. This is made worse by consistent action cancelling.

TLDR: Not recommended for encouraging obsessive FOMO buying, outdated spaghetti code filled with bugs, and excessive limitations."

An introduction: 
Welcome to Rust, the 3D alternative to Stardew Valley. As a working man, with a mundane 9-5 Job, this is the perfect escape! I love coming home after a long day of work to this wonderful community, and the charming people that make it so great. The last few years have been difficult, inflation, stagflation,shrinkflation,masturbation...and so on. Life has been tough for everyone and this is one of the best communities to spend your downtime with. Having played for many hours, and met so many new friends who have given me tours of their farms, and even donated valuable equipment to help me get started on my farming experience! (M249 Harvest Machine, the L96 Tractor, AK Seeds, HQM Ploughing equipment) . My experience has been great in summary, and this has been one of the most relaxing games to play , even on the steam deck! Its a rewarding game in my opinion, that values your time and brings people together!

The Pro's:
1.) Incredible Anti-Cheat: This is industry leading anti cheat software, ensuring you and your friends can all farm in peace!
2.) Relaxing: You can sink countless hours into the game , building your farm knowing the community wont grief or try to ruin your play experience.
3.) Value for Time: Unlike most games, your farm progress will save, so when you come home from work the following day everything will be as you've left it! 
4.) Community: Everyone is really kind on this game, and help each other out often! 
5.) The Graphics: 11/10, this is the engine Unreal 5 is based on, with industry leading volumetric clouds, server meshing and path tracing, the game stands out and looks the best in 490x234 @ 144hz, make sure to enable HDR 400 for that extra pop! 

The cons: 
1.) Sometimes i log on and my farm has disappeared, i'm not sure why but it may be because i didnt pay for a planning permit (still figuring this out) 
2.) Sometimes other farmers accidentally blow up my walls and are wearing my clothes, im  not sure why, think its a glitch? 
3.) Sometimes my sleeping bags and beds get changed to rude words, i think its a glitch on the server i played? 
4.) Sometimes i seem to be taken to modded servers with guns and explosives etc... i think thats on me though i must be connecting to custom games or LAN games. 
5.) I'm running the game on an i5-2800 , 11GB RAM (i know its a lot) and an ATI Radeon 8800 (2gb vram i know its overkill but i do graphic design for the Ugandan FA as a side hustle). I still seem to lag though and sometimes only get 239 FPS which is weird because i installed another RGB fan in my PC last week... any help with this? is it because i keep it one colour? 

The Conclusion:

In summary rust is one of the best farming simulators out there! if you want relaxation, some puzzles and to make new friends along the way! (or farm solo) then this game is for you!

76561198030781450,881020,False,0.56318432092666626,"This game was a lot of fun at the beginning.  I love the art design, and the early boss battles were really awesome.  For the first 80 or so hours, I was having the most fun with any game that I've played in awhile. 
 Unfortunately, I don't think they spent enough time polishing the end game experience, which should be the highlight in this type of game.  There's no single game killing flaw, but the combination of a multitude of issues, which all show up in the post game, gnaws away at the experience and enjoyment of the game. 

- No variety in the quest type at the end game.  There's several different quest types that you'll encounter at the lower difficulties, but at the end game it's only boss battles.  Creating proud level versions of these other quest types would help keep the gameplay from getting too repetitive.

- Progression in the post game is poorly paced.  There's a lot of things prior to reaching the endgame that players skip just because the time investment is not it.  Levelling the rank 4 and lower sigils, and leveling your ascension weapons are the two big examples.  

- Character abilities are also poorly balanced at the end game.  The game has damage caps for all attacks, and once you reach that limit a lot of support abilities that increase attack or decrease enemy defense now become useless.  Everything switches to either increasing the damage cap or dealing damage outside the cap.  You can't play as a support character at the end game, because buffs do nothing when everyone is limited by the damage cap.  It doesn't seem like they put much thought into how the game would play and balance at the end.

- The devs are completely enamored with cinematic cut scenes during the fights.  The pacing is okay when you're first clearing things, but on repeated clears it just draws the battle out for too long.  I wish they had kept the cinematics to the battles during the story missions, and reduced them for the post game.

- The Devs aren't communicating with players about upcoming changes.  The latest patch had a lot of adjustments to character abilities that caught people off guard.  Some things like abilities using the wrong damage cap were clearly bugs that would get fixed one day.  However animation cancelling is common in other games, so no one was clear if that was intended or not.  The Devs never acknowledged whether something was intended behavior or whether it was an issue that would get patched.  They just dropped a bunch of nerfs and adjustments into a patch that was only announced to be adding a new boss fight.

-So many missing QoL features.  You'll collect hundreds of sigil and wrightstones, but you can't page through them.  You just have to keep pressing the down button to scroll through them one at a time.  Of course there's everyone's favorite complaint of the transmute system.  Handing tickets in one at a time is the biggest time waster I've seen in a recent game.  One of the few announcements we've gotten from the Devs is that this will be fixed eventually.  I'm just left wondering why they didn't think this would be an issue before they shipped the game.  It's this more than anything else that makes me believe they didn't sufficiently play test the end game experience.

- Worst part about the end game for me was the shift towards all of the enemies attacks being insta-kills.  Healing abilities and items become useless, and you instead just start stacking resurrection items or invulnerabilities.  It makes most of the fights very frustrating to learn, and it overemphasizes high DPS.  The faster you can kill the boss, then the fewer attacks you'll need to deal with.  It doesn't help that most of the fights have a strict DPS check at the end that will wipe the party if you tried to play defensively.

- Trying to build more than one character is just brutal in this game.  I was able to get enough drops to completely unlock two weapons, but to do a third would take dozens of hours more to farm the silver centrum needed.  Anyone who's maxxed several character has resorted to AFK farming for this material.  If you've made a task so tedious and boring that people are only doing it if it can be done automatically, then the devs really need to rethink their approach to the end game grind.

- Finally, the Quick Quest and gold dahlia badge system needs to be adjusted.  Conceptually, this is suppose to encourage people to play multiplayer.  However, the rewards are just too little.  It takes about 75 to 90 Quick Quests to get a material that you could have gotten in 5 quests  yourself.  Since Quick Quests can place you in a low level battle that won't have any useful rewards for end game players, the gold dahlia badges are the only reward you'll earn for completing Quick Quests.  It just isn't worth your time to run the Quick Quests.  They really need to drop the number of gold dahlia badges that you need for certain items.  Running Quick Quests should be the fastest way to get a specific treasure, but you should be limited in the number of Quick Quests that you can do each day.  This would help keep casual players from getting frustrated by the grind and it would also make sure that more people are available for match making.

I hope that Cygames takes the lessons from this game and comes back with an improved sequel in the future.  I had a lot of fun with the early parts of the game, but the lack of polish for the end game soured the overall experience."

The LUCILIUS release really goes to show the direction the game is heading towards.
You need to kill a tedious boss for a C H A N C E to get a Tear. 
You need 5 tears to get a single N E W damage cap sigil 
You need 4 of those new sigils per character
You need a couple of tears that you get by C H A N C E to upgrade those sigils to +14

All in all you're looking at about 160 TEARS that M I G H T drop after a kill.

76561198159951665,881020,False,0.542884111404418945,"Having known nothing about granblue, this game heavily baited me into thinking it was a fantasy game with a diverse set of characters that all have differing play styles that made even repeatable content enjoyable, but at the endgame it ended feeling like a gacha-game.  From what I can tell, this game would best suit those into extremely large time investments in order to acquire minuscule rewards... so prolly gacha players.
Pros:
- The combat feels great, characters all have unique move sets with their own tech and mechanics.
- Music is VERY pleasant, one of my favorite parts of the game.  Although it would definitely sound similar to other jrpg/anime soundtracks to those that don't care for audio.
- Audio design is great, from sound ques alone I can make well timed reactions to most attacks.
- Character animations and effects are very flashy and suit the characters very well.

Cons:
- Upon reaching Proud difficulty quests (The current hardest), the game essentially becomes an active and afk grind that forces everyone to become damage dealers.
- Late game bosses are basically stat checks that force you into run away phases where you're forced to watch the boss do cool shit that'll one-shot you if you aren't paying attention.
- The story is extremely cliched and just downright boring to push through. The game requires you to play it in order to get to the real gameplay, but it keeps you invested by giving you constant rewards as you do.
- The sigil system is probably the most important thing when increasing you characters power, but because of the damage cap system, half of your sigils on any character will be exactly the same every time.
- Healers are useless, Tanks are quest specific while a little less useless, while DPS are king.
- Large amount of time = little amount of reward. Not much to expand on, shit feels like walking through a desert for one good swig of water.
- Also the recent patch kinda screwed things for matchmaking, as well as removing animation cancelling without giving the characters that relied on it to stay relevant any buffs to counteract what would essentially be a nerf.  

Overall, if you enjoy the game that's great and I can understand why some people would enjoy it, but the cons just kill the fun for me."
76561198048189696,881020,False,0.542699694633483887,"The premise itself is good, but the execution is really poor.

1. This game is grindy but does not respect your time. Everything is random including the best weapon (the worst part, the weapon is random too for which character). Thus a lot of time you will stuck in same quest in hopping to get that 1 item with amount of 1 when you need 5 to whooping 20-50. There is a also really great design choice why this game does not respect your time: you can only sells or trade with limited amount while you have a bunch of sigils or stone you want to trade (oh and hope your mouse button or controller button really good as you will need it to speedup the process of transmutation for sigil or stone). How about old sigils ? Well once you get to sigils V, you can put sigils I below that to trash (+ your resource to upgrade them too).

2. Oh it has lot of character, looks like it will fun....... NO !!! Due to reason number 1, you will need a freaking lot of time to build your character. And you know which is good ? You get terminus weapon for character you never use. Yeah.... Let's put your effort down to drain (or keep farming terminus weapon and hoping it drops for your character).

3. Oh look, there are a lot of sigils with different effect, it will have variety of build right ? NO. This game only ask you 1 thing and it is DPS. Heck even for the best weapon, it ask you to have below 45k HP to get the buff. Thus screw those health sigil, screw those aegis sigil, etc. But but but... I still can have other build right ? NO, because later, the enemy has DPS check (heck the sub objective also ask you to defeat the enemy in less than 1/6 of the stage time). Which eventually your build will stuck on more DPS. Lucius patch (new patch) even make this more clear. New sigil = moar DPS, his mechanic = moar DPS as if you lack DPS bye bye your HP (thus making tanky build is a void). In addition, they basically put a bad mechanic in this game: DAMAGE CAP. Thus in endgame, you will need a bunch of this sigils to unlock your character power (I mean DPS).

4. Lot of lazy design to make the game harder. What I mean for this, in proud difficulity, you will fight a group of boss. But there is a caveat, the boss which is not the main boss will do only 1 or 2 move. That skeleton boss which you fight has some move ? Now it becomes not main boss and what does it do ? Spam AOE.

Unless you are into this kind of thing, I fully not recommend this game."

76561198083291258,881020,True,0.523809552192687988,This game is good for farmer
76561198009840471,881020,True,0.523809552192687988,"At the time of writing this review, version 1.1.1 has come out (with the final quest that has been planned for now). Would highly recommend, though be warned there is a fair bit of grinding involved in the late gate (to prepare yourself for this final quest). I will try to avoid spoilers in this review.

This games introduction section is fairly clear. It tells you all the controls of the game and has you using them to clear the early section. From there, the early game through the story is quite simple to understand. At certain points, the battles in the story do get harder (even just on the normal difficulty) where you might see that the enemies start damage-sponging more. This can be remedied by doing all the ""Quests"" you have unlocked (the ones at the quest counter, not the npc-quest). You can of course skip this, but the game does then become a real tough one (even if you play really well, your ai will start suffering due to them being underleveled and no masteries).

After you have beat the story (estimate around 10 hrs or so), know that this is when the real game begins. From here, focus on doing the ""Quests"" on the quest counter. They do get much harder as you go, do not worry if they seem easy at the beginning. Also, you will encounter many of the same bosses that you have already faced, except they will get more and more mechanics you have to deal with.

The grind in this game is fairly light at the beginning, but after a certain point the grind will increase massively (once you hit the later quest of proud difficulty). 

Now, as for the art. I like the 2d art used for all the characters in this game. The stickers in this game are absolutely adorable. The 3d character models were very fine as well, though a lot of the enemy ones get reused later on with a new shade of paint on them. 

The music used in this game is fantastic, A lot of the themes for the towns and stages are perfect at providing a certain feeling that the set wants you to feel. Many of the boss tracks are VERY good, giving the boss fights a good excitement factor to them. 

All in all, would I recommend this game? Absolutely. Despite the ridiculous amount of grinding you will do later if you want to beat this final quest, getting to the second last quest is relatively light on the grind. The game is worth it just for that experience, even more so if you are alright with the grinding to beat that final one. 

And yes, despite 357 hours in this game, I am no where near maxing all of the end game weapons (still need to max 5 of them). 

If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the comments and I will try to respond."
76561198078482250,881020,True,0.523809552192687988,"I love this game for what it is, but it has some glaring issues that I feel should be emphasized for gamers looking for a worthwhile experience. 

Cons first:
-For those who are not grind inclined, skip this game. It's a very grind heavy game with several RNG drops for optimizing builds (although the terminus weps  have a pity system, it's the sigil grind that will burn you out as it has with a lot of players).
-Build diversity: in this game is almost nonexistent, with most players aiming to build 4-5 DMG CAP sigils on their builds in a game that only has 12 sigil slots, with an added 3 for survival, being Guts, Auto Revive, and Potion Hoarder. This leaves just 4 other sigils for tuning your own playstyle, which just isn't enough. 
- Matchmaking: is wonderful with everyone playing to each other's strengths, and at its worse, a load screen, or freeze up while connecting, resulting in  Alt+F4 simulator.
- REMARKABLE! UNBELIEVABLE! The bird by Sierro is now a community meme, and the stuff of nightmares. This brings up how bad the RNG really is at end game, Sigil farming is a repetitive process of farming Silver Centrum, weapon crystals, recycling materials to buy sigils, and farming literally hundreds of curios for your sigils, unless you're save scumming or cheat engining for it. Literally hours of your life sitting and listening to the bird scream out how amazing your 80th Overdrive Assassin V+ is. 
-The UI of Sigil inventory, yes, there's a sorting system, but the sorting system should allow you to sort by actual trait. So instead of scrolling through the 20+ Tyranny V+s to reach DMG CAP V+ sigils, you should just be able to search for a particular trait. 
-The Camera. You will find that the camera in this game is an enemy. Locking on can feel clunky, auto targetting can feel off as you stand next to an enemy, use an attack or skill and find your character aiming for someone else. In those MMO mechanic checks, you'll find that the camera angle can throw off your idea of how to move or dodge.
-Repetitive Boss fights with unskippable cutscene transitions. The first time a boss does a phase shift, its cool, it's hype, but by the 4th or 5th time you've seen it, you wish you could just skip it. And by the 40th fight, you'll just tab out and do something else until you know it's done.  To clarify, I don't mind repetitive boss fights, I love Monster Hunter afterall, but the scene transitions make me want to commit the unalive move especially when I know that I'll have to grind out another 3-10 more runs. 

Pros:
For those who embrace the grind, for those who love the challenge of learning or mastering a character's skillset, and for those who love MMO mechanics in an action RPG setting, get this game. 

As an action RPG, this game hits a lot of notes.
-Characters:  The gameplay is satisfying with each character offering a completely new experience to every fight. 
-Visuals: This game is stunning, the environments and arenas are fun to explore and fight in, even though it gets repetitive. 
-Community: You'll find that there's a lot of content creators, players, and fans ready to engage with you about GBF. Lore videos, guides for boss fights, for characters, and a deep love for the game, you'll find it here. 
-Combat: NUMBERS GO BRR! I have to emphasize the fact that every character feels unique and how they interact within combat adds to the appeal of this game. The combat system is responsive, with a high skill ceiling for most of the cast offering small tricks to improve efficacy within each character's gameplay. Bosses are fun with interesting mechanics that invite the player to really test their timing or ability to read patterns . 
-FULL ASSIST/ASSIST MODE. Although this mode at end game is used for AFK farming, I think more games should follow suit and add a similar system. There's some gamers out there, whether they're disabled, or just don't have the time or skill to sink into this game, but still want to experience it...well THEY CAN! They can absolutely experience this game using this option up until Extreme difficulty. 

For the Lucius update that dropped. I think that the changes they made to certain characters were unwarranted. That's not to say that I'm a meta slave or that I suck at the game and should get gud, but I think a game, especially a PVE game benefits more from having every character be OP instead of nerfing characters in order to ""balance"" the game state, especially when the grind in this game is atrocious. Also, I write this with respect to the time investment necessary to really experience this game. The story is 10-12 hours counting the post-story chapter with hundreds available for grinding the necessary materials to build your specific characters. 

I absolutely adore this game, but it's out of love that I say that you should only purchase this game if you know what you're getting into, otherwise, you'll find yourself unable to enjoy this game past the story. And for what its worth, when I got this game, I played it nonstop, it was just that fun, I sunk whole days because this game was so engaging."

With the latest Paradox mess they've created I am going to take the time to negatively rate the game. This is mostly because Paradox doesn't respect the investments of its loyal fan base. They make content that should have been in the base game DLC, then when they get angry feedback based on their latest pack, instead of treating their most loyal fans with respect, they go about making content they already own free and included in the base game. This content will probably be repackaged into a new ""DLC"" later on and we will have to pay for it again. Although a torrent of negative comments exist on the latest game update, the devs don't even address the anger at all. They just ignore it. Confirming they really do not care about their most loyal fans. They want to capture new players with free candy while spitting in the faces of their most loyal players.

My suggestion is to just not buy Paradox content anymore. Eventually it will probably just become free like Crusader Kings II. If you really want to buy a game, just buy the base game on sale and just don't buy any of the content since it will probably be made free anyways. They fragment their games in a endless torrent of ""DLCs"" which almost are indistinguishable from micro-transactions.

Waking the Tiger.
Death or Dishonor
Together for Victory
Sabaton Soundtrack volume 1, and then it stopped.

No DLC more was given. As of 14 Mar 2024, Paradox is giving away Waking the Tiger, Death or Dishonor and Together for Victory for free. Us early supporters are getting fucked in the ass again. 

I have bought only one more DLC since then, and have stopped buying Paradox DLC. Paradox's games used to be great, but is now complete nonsense. Look what they did to CK II: after some years they gave CK II away for free, why? Because the DLC at normal price costs like $500.  I lived in an era where games cost $30, and an expansion would costs $10 and actually be good, not like these $25 DLC which wreck the game. 

No matter how good Paradox's games are (and they have steadily and not that slowly declined), this behaviour should not and must not be encouraged.

I knew I had to get the absolute best ending and complete absolutely everything I wanted to in this game before committing to writing this review, and that is what I've done. [b] Persona 5: Royal [/b] if by far one of the best games I have ever played, and perhaps one of the best pieces of art to ever reach the medium that is gaming. This was an absolute delight to play, for all 174 hours that I've played. I acknowledge this type of game might not be for everyone but at least hear me out.

[h2] Pros and Cons [/h2]

Pros:

‚Ä¢Amazing Music
‚Ä¢Incredible Art Style
‚Ä¢Excellent Story
‚Ä¢Incredible Writing (Characters, World-building etc.)
‚Ä¢So much to do

Cons:

‚Ä¢Very long (honestly a pro imo but could easily be a con to many)
‚Ä¢Can be a little tedious in certain segments 

[h2] Story [/h2]

I could go on forever about this. In my 174 hours I managed to get through the story twice in order to get the true ending that I wanted, and I was never to upset to be replaying a story I'd already witnessed. Every moment of this story is engaging and exciting, and I would play it all over again. It follows a group of rebellious teens as they face the evils of the world and vow to change the world for the better. Through forces much beyond them, they are granted the power to do so and are given rebellious forms that can be used against the evils of the world, and turn them good. I don't want to spoil too much, but it's full off emotion, humour and plenty of intense action sequences too. I cannot talk this games story up enough, and it might just be the best video game story I ever have and ever will experience. 

[h2] Gameplay [/h2]

This is where this game is probably most divided. I understand that turn-based combat is not the most engaging type of combat system in the world but It's something that I think Persona 5 has done better than any other game before it. It's not simple turns as you would have it, sure it can be but it can help to look turns ahead, to make sure you're exploiting enemy weaknesses and making the most out of the games system such as baton passes, technicals and the ability to swap personas at will. The combat system is only as interesting as you want to make it. Sure, you can just spam strong moves and nothing else, but in higher difficulties that will not get you far at all, and it just isn't a good way to play. 

Outside of combat there is an entire side of Japan waiting for you too explore and run around in. Based off of real parts of Japan, these beautiful areas are stocked full of things to do, people to talk to, things to buy and stories for you to experience. There is never a dull moment in this game and I felt myself looking forwards to things constantly such as hanging out with a certain person next or finally being able to visit a certain location with a character I liked. Running around in the world is incredibly entertaining and although it isn't seamless, it certainly feels so. The beautiful music and overall UI design in this game is completely unmatched by anything I've ever seen before. The love that went into this soundtrack and the overall feel of the game is something that you can feel every second that you're playing. It's absolutely beautiful and makes you want to keep playing for as long as you can, it was hard to accept that it was late and hop off this beauty some nights.

[h2] Graphics [/h2]

I've already talked this up enough in other segments but I think it deserves it own section here. The game employs a mix of 3D gameplay, cinematic in-game footage, 3D rendered cut scenes and it's very own 2D cut-scenes straight from the anime. The blend together flawlessly and it's never a jarring moment when the game switches from any one. The overall look of the game can be quite bland if you focus too much on certain spots, but overall it's make with just enough love and detail that it can look amazing when it's all blended together with the voice acting, scenery and beautiful music. The modes, boss palaces and pretty much all of Japan that you are able to explore look absolutely stunning, especially the models for characters and personas. Despite this game not being the best in terms of graphic fidelity, I would say that it more than makes up for that with it's incredible unique design and art style, and that alone is able to solidify this as one of the most beautiful looking and feeling games I've ever picked up in my entire life.

[h2] Final Thoughts [/h2]

This is not a game that I am ever going to forget for as long as I live. I will be listening to this soundtrack till the day I die and I will not forget this game nor this series until the day I die. The third semester of this game might be the best Persona experience I've ever had and it was an absolute joy to experience, wrapping up this amazing game absolutely flawlessly. 10/10 this is a masterpiece that I hope will never be forgotten in the world of gaming and that I hope only continues to receive even more love and support as the years go on. If you're hesitant to try this game, don't be. If you're scared of the long playtime, don't be. Go at your own pace and experience every step of this masterpiece as you see fit. If i could play it all over again for the first time, I would do it in a heartbeat."

This is the only turn based rpg game i have liked ever, and the fact is im still not a fan of turn based combat but this game does so much more that, that you forget that you are playing one. The combat is fast and dynamic, the weak point system is great, and collecting and fusing personas is very fun. The social sim aspect is crazy good, there is so much stuff to do in Tokyo in between missions its insane. And everything you do, playing games, working out, hanging out with people, gives you social stats that make its so you are always progressing your character. The best part of the game is the story which is long as hell but never boring, it is a bit cliche and has a lot of classic anime tropes but i have enjoyed the story from start to end. And the second best part is the music, it has arguably the best soundtrack of any game and i often find myself listening to the music when im out and about.

76561198086696765,2379780,False,0.545165419578552246,"A surprisingly addictive game, ruined by the fact that most runs are impossible to win at high stakes, especially if you do not rely on the boring meta. 

Don't get me wrong, I love hard games. As a matter of fact, the first thing I look for on rogue-lite negative comments are people saying that the game is too hard. That is a bonus for me. I am a glutton for punishment. However, this is not that. 

When I say it is impossible to win most runs, I mean it is impossible to win most runs. To show you what I mean, here is a breakdown of how to start your runs at high stakes:

1) Win the first ante with 1 hand to ensure you have enough cash to buy a good joker in the shop. Can you win in 1 hand? No? Time to re-roll your run.

2) Check the shop. Is there a half decent joker there? Great! No? Time to re-roll your run. 

If you do not follow these steps, you absolutely, without a doubt, will lose your run by the 4th blind due to the crazy high difficulty scaling and have to restart anyways. The biggest problem here is the fact that the shop consistently offers you tarot and planet card, which are not really worth your money until later in the run due to the interest system. When the shop isn't offering you tarot and planet cards, it is offering you a joker that is too niche to be useful at the start of the game. This leads to constant restarts, whether you have the foresight to just re-roll in the first round, or try to defy the inevitable by progressing without decent jokers. 

I realized that I was spending about 3/4 of my time playing this game just wasting time by restarting my runs. I will mention that the rest of the time that you spend progressing is actually very fun! However, even that fun is bogged down by an incredibly boring and repetitive meta. 

As it stands, the only consistent way to win the game is with high card. That does not mean you cannot win with other hand types, but high card is certainly the most powerful. This is because of 2 key pieces: 

1) Consistency: The inherent problem in a game like this is that, while you can tailor your build to any complex hand you like, your run can get borked at any moment due to bad rng when you don't draw it. Are you doing a flush build? 3 of a kind? Full house? Cool. What if you don't draw that hand? You lose your run, that's what. There are things you can do to mitigate this, but it will never be guaranteed that your hand will be drawn when you need it. 

2) Scaling: There are a lot of jokers that have neat scaling ideas like [+ mult for every played hand / - mult for every discard], [+ mult for every time a hand has been played this game], and [+ $ for no discard] to name a few. The problem with these kinds of jokers and their scaling around hands played and discards ties right back up to the consistency piece. What is the one hand you know you can play any time? What is the one hand you will never have to discard to find? High card. Because of this, it has synergy with more jokers than any other hand by a wide margin. 

All of that to say, there is something really special here. This game can be crazy addictive. What the game needs is to follow through on it's addictive gameplay, by allowing me to actually take part in the addictive gameplay instead of a reroll simulator with the same boring loop of a meta."

Morrowind was the first non MMO I played on the computer, It was glorious I would download almost any mod I could find, and enhance the game in many eventful and exciting ways..  I never actually finished Morrowind, but I loved that game to pieces..  Then I got oblivion, unfortunately Oblivion was far too advanced for my poor computer, but I played it on Xbox 360 instead.. it was good, didn't really hold up to Morrowind but still good..  Then came Skyrim or as I like to call it The Milk Maid as Beth Milked it to death.. This was the first game that really had people wishing for a co/op mode..  

Beth being the oppertunist they are saw dollar signs and created the MMO Elder Scrolls online..  The masses rejoiced.. well actually they complained because the game was pretty devoid of almost anything that made the Elder Scrolls great..  10 years later and the game is in a far better state but still lacking in alot of ways..

The Story - Well it's an MMO, most MMO's don't really have a story, this one kinda does,, although I don't know what it is.. something about A prophet, and betrayal and Daedric princes or something... who knows..

Game play - If you've played the Elder Scrolls then you pretty much know how this game plays,  do quest, steal stuff, sell stuff, buy stuff, make stuff... etc etc etc..  Funtimes to be had by almost all..

Pro's - 

Hours and hours and hours of gameplay..  
Huge game, compared to The Elder Scroll games we're used too.
Decent substitute until Elder Scrolls 6 comes out

Con's

not really as fun as a core elder scrolls game/
Even with 10 years in the can, the game still feels empty
Only 25 quest at a time (with thousands of quest in the game, 25 is too few. you'll often find yourself with a full quest journal and frustration will ensue)
Inventory issues if you aren't sub scribed to ESO+

Recommendation - 

If you've never played TESO before, now might be as good a time as any,, if you buy the newest expansion you get access to all the previous releases, which will add potentially thousands of hours of gameplay..   The game really has alot of content, but even with all that content eventually the game starts to feel like it Drags.. with leveled enemies, you never really feel overpowered and even at max level you can die to some random creature you were killing with ease earlier in the game..

If you're a fan of MMO's then this game will be a good addition to your game playing,,  while it's more like a solo MMO, it does have some group content, which I can't really comment on, and I hear it might have raids, but I have zero experience in this game with raids or more then group content..  

I'd recommend buying the newest expansion which at the time of this review was Gold Road..   I'd also ask Beth to increase the quest journal size another 10 quest or so..   it's really needed after 10 years.."

my next point is the game play, the battle system has an enormous skill ceiling and is very rewarding to learn, outside of battle the civilisation system is so much fun as each faction adds huge changes to how your civilisation functions, to chaos factions spreading plagues to rats that build nukes under other peoples homes to dwarves never forgiving people. this variety leads nicely into my third point

my third point on why warhammer total war is so amazing is the repeatability, even after several play throughs of the game i still feel as though i have more game play to enjoy, each faction having a unique play-style and units causes each new run to feel so fresh.

my final point is the DLC value, i haven't bought all the DLCs but the ones that i have add so much to the game, my personal favourite is the chaos dwarves because their artillery looks sick as well as the elite units being terrifying, the steampunk engineer vibe of the dwarves faction mixed with the blood lust rage of chaos makes the chaos dwarves look stunning.

There is a lot more then meets the eye here - The amount of depth present is surprisingly high considering the perceived limitations present.

A lot of time has also went into the UX of this game - something that is often overlooked.  Most of the features you hope would be present are here and the game is just fun to dink around in.

I will say that this game does run into the problems that many games with 'lots of choice' often do:  Much of the choice is an illusion and it breaks down as you start ascending the ranks to but a couple 'real' choices.  Don't mistake this though for a lack of depth.  There is definitely some rigidity to what is 'good', but there are also many relevant decisions to be made.

The game had a pretty good demo, but a lot of what ended up in the release product is completely untested.

Now, this kind of game isn't going to be for everyone.  Its a unique kind of asymmetrical, competitive, auto-battling puzzle game? But if you are into games like Super Auto Pets - you will love this too.  
  
Although its just in early access, it has 4 classes, with 5 subclasses each. Tons of items, recipes, and strategies.  Every game you start from a small backpack and gradually build it into something huge and deadly.  Unlike super auto pets where all the synergy happens in a straight line, the strategy here is spread across a grid. Items need to be placed next to other items, in certain backpack types, with enough resource generation in other parts. This is why I call it a 'puzzle' game - because you will spend a lot of time organizing and optimizing your loadout before each round to maximize your chances.  If you have a brain that enjoys optimization - you will love this game.  
  
However, if you aren't sure - download the demo! It has 2/4 current classes and a ton of items still. Play it for a couple (dozen) hours and you'll know if you want the full game or not."

Perfect little game on the side, or if you have a baby/toddler so you can't spend too much time at once behind the PC.
None of the gameplay is in real time, you can take as long as you need before deciding to head into battle and even then you're basically fighting a ghost of another player's backpack that's on the same round as you are (I think, might be based on wins/losses, not sure)

This also means you don't have to pay attention to any opponent's builds either and instead just build a fun backpack or kickass strategies you want.

By sheer luck, my gigantic, misshapen backpack was completely stuffed to the brim with a variety of weapons, animals, armors, fruits, and accessories - cushioning me from a fall that certainly would've concussed me.

I would say the first 10 games I played were great, but after that I noticed an annoying pattern.   I wanted to try different combos but I didn't have the gold or shop luck to pull them off.

No problem, just try again... well the problem is that the result is almost always the same.  Fall into the loop of using the broken combos or lose chasing the chance of pulling an interesting combo.  You only have a limited number of rounds and gold to get the combo that interests you.   If I was younger I might welcome hours of grinding to catch a glimpse of a combo, but the fact that you can just look them up in the in game item guide ruins the mystery, and you'll face a ton of computer players who somehow managed to pull off combos which you would have needed several more rounds to aquire, or perfect shop knowledge.

The ""ranking"" system doesn't really make much sense to me.  Feels like an off the shelf solution put in place without much thought as to how the player would interact with it.   It failed to motivate me to want to play more to get more, nor did the skins you could unlock with them interest me at all.

But wile I will recommend this game to everyone for years upon years. I have to be honest. With 1000 hours so far i have experienced this game have Huge ping or tick rate issues. before it wasn't to bad to deal with from time to time. tho annoying I have found ways to deal with it and become even better from it.
for those who want to know i`ve been in astral 2 before and was stuck due to having too many matches where my average score was higher than the entire lobby giving me less points even if i fought in the castle, doing the challenge when it spawns and coming 3rd 2nd or 1st. no complaint on that.
But to continue my main point. 24 Entertainment needs to desperately fix the ping or tick rate issue. 2 days ago, i have been experiencing way more inconsistencies. as a matter a fact its so bad now i`ve become so afraid to engage in fights because i`m not sure what could cause me to lose the entire fight. for context. there are times i will hit someone who clearly should get hit stunned, ignore damage and normal attack me, i have clips that show them not even glow blue to avoid the stagger and i have been losing that way frequently recently, another issue is that way more of my combos at 20-45 ping will fail and i have to be making new combos that work on higher ping players. with the risk of having more inconsistent movement. all of this is just a small portion of what i`ve had to deal with wile trying to be really good at the game.
why is it that people who have higher ping have a higher advantage over lower ping players. this NEEDS to be addressed. i have reached my limit. this needs to be fixed. until this gets fixed i will not change my review. i`m just one person but i`m sure a lot of people who have this way worst than me. PLEASE fix this. its terrible.

lastly there are times where the game with lag out for no reason especially when you load into a match and its at 144fps but then drops to 12fps or lower when you look at a specific player or players. like what even is that. if i restart my game mid match all lag goes away. is there some memory issue with the game? how long is this going to keep happening. and its not my pc. i had a friend buy parts to make his new pc, experience the same issue and upon restarting the game is back t normal.

Just pros and cons:

Pros: 
A really rare case when you have no interest in asian culture at all you may deal with some cosmetics in this game and overall pretty decent combat mechanics and the graphics so far! 

Character customization (face only with haircut and the body color) is the one of the strongest part of the game. You can pretty simple customize your character whatever you want with even importing photo or pic with face!

You have a good choice among the characters in the game. 19 characters in the game so far.

And looks like where all the pros end


Cons:

Game interface is more like mobile game with overloaded of tons of annoying notifications and stupid window at the start opens daily.  

You need very often click or hit the button twice during the game, whatever you want to grab a weapon or just drop something. 

The most annoying thing is multiplayer lobby! You have to wait everyone in your lobby hit the ""start button"" to start matchmaking in 2024! So annoying and primitive! The devs still can't copy all that stuff they already copied from other games, but this basic thing! 

Trash matchmaking with randoms. You can simply match with dude from bronze or gold when you're over 3,5k elo in 3k+ lobby for no reason. Which it is not possible to do so in your lobby at all, lmao. And those dudes are not smurfs they real newbies. ""Balanced"" matchmaking is a myth. Yeah, even when the devs finally turn game into f2p this issue still exist like you still get tons of bots in any lobby.

We all know whos this game and in-game censor so weird and ridiculous. The devs must keep all their local issues locally, tho. I won't even mention about that case with the skins, such a shame! We also facing all female characters too skinny and looks like there is the only one model with different faces and the skins, hah.

And the last thing about the ""op chinese players"" myth. Mb it was at the beginning when just a few players played this game facing dominating cn players in their lobbies. Now we're entirely dominating in our region, just no cap!

Initially, I wanted to delve into the details of why and how much I dislike this game, considering its wasted potential and amazing premise. However, the final result would've been too lengthy to read, and while it still is, there's way more to talk about than what I'll be stating below, but I'll leave it at that. Note that this review is solely about the ""in-game"" experience, and outside issues like ""ew, Chinese spyware"" and whatever else are not present within it.
[hr][/hr]

[b]Starting with the positives.[/b]

[h3]First:[/h3] No pandering to the biologically retarded, sexually overactive, violent, ugly apes and the like (I am a racist.) The basic characters in it do not represent the common western characters even a bit, and that's the main positive point for this game that is somewhat connected to the second one.

[h3]Second:[/h3] The setting. Personally, I like the theme of the stereotypical traditional East-Asian world with its quirks and gimmicks. The whole melee-oriented battle experience with weapons that aren't typically used in Western games is really pleasing and appreciated. The graphics and terrain look nice, pleasant, and appealing to the eyes. The number of playable characters with their background stories and abilities blends well with the overall aesthetic of the game, making it more integral.

[h3]Third:[/h3] It's updated somewhat frequently. The updates are consistent, and while most of them focus on cosmetics, the game does receive meaningful and ""fruitful"" updates that impact it noticeably. These include new characters, mechanics, additional points on the map providing boosts, etc.

[h3]Fourth:[/h3] The abilities and the characters themselves. They are truly distinct from each other, with versatile approaches and intricacies in their playstyles. While the combat is primarily influenced by the weapons, the unique abilities of each character have a significant impact on the battle and have engaging usage. Additionally, it's noteworthy that this game is not in any way a ""pay-to-win"" experience.
[hr][/hr]

[b]Having covered the positive aspects, let us now delve into the negative facets.[/b]

[h3]The parrying system.[/h3] It's ridiculously unresponsive and unreliable. The game initially teaches parrying as a skill to be improved over time, emphasizing timing and reaction. However, in later encounters, regardless of precise timing with any weapon, opponents will ignore parries 60% of the time, hitting with charged attacks right through it. It's infuriating when your well-timed parries are visibly ignored, even though you, your teammates, and likely your enemies saw that you pressed it on time (indicated by the red flash).

[h3]The movement.[/h3] I don't believe any Assassin's Creed game comes even remotely close to how awkward the movement and climbing are here. About half the time, your character just won't go where you want him to. They might get stuck in normal spots, hang on the edge of a building without climbing up, or stubbornly stick to a wall, ignoring your directions until you press ""C"" (sometimes you have to spam it because your character really dislikes following your input) to drop down and start climbing all over again. There are hooks that make things a bit easier, but only if the animation of ""flying"" with it to your target won't get instantly interrupted/cancelled by whatever there may be. Roughly 40‚Äì50% of the things that look like you could hook onto in the game, such as trees, wooden trunks, and some building edges, are actually just visual textures, not real objects you can use. This is misleading since at the start of the game, you expect most things to be usable to escape from your pursuers, but the hook just goes right through these objects, wasting your time and lowering your chances of getting away. The movement in battles works the same way, meaning it's ridiculously unresponsive/unreliable to the point where your character just randomly decides to stand still for 3 seconds, despite you pressing the buttons to move on to wherever you think you should.

[h3]The community.[/h3] As a whole it's not inherently toxic. However, many skilled players exhibit an unwarranted ego. The outcome of the game is largely a matter of chance, and even if you're more skilled, you might find yourself at the mercy of the game's unpredictable nature. While toxic players are not the norm, they aren't exactly rare either, and they are remarkably delusional morons. 
For instance, in a non-ranked match when I was still new to the game, I encountered a situation where I obtained the key for the cave, went there, and on the way notified my teammate about my actions multiple times, yet he did not care. Consequently, I got ganked and died once. Upon respawning, my supposedly experienced teammate ventured to the same cave alone, died, and instead of waiting for me or respawning, he had a meltdown and left. 
(Back then, I didn't know what that puzzle was.)
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3031413282
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3031413233
I've had a few similar situations; most of them were literally just ""someone starts to throw tantrums at you for the most arbitrary things."" While there were decent and friendly people I befriended, the community is generally a hit or miss, comprised mainly of middle-low priority individuals.

[h3]The mechanics.[/h3] This game has the abundance of hidden niche mechanics and the ""stun-to-win"" melee system that create an immeasurable skill gap. If you anticipate winning by playing according to the game's initial teachings, you'd be mistaken. It is filled with numerous concealed mechanics related to melee attacks and their animations. By the time you grasp one, your opponent might have executed multiple different combos within 20 seconds or less, swiftly defeating and looting you before moving on to the next target. All you can do is stand still, stunned, throughout the entire beating.

[h3]Appalling.[/h3] Japanese localization has english-borrowed degenerate katakana words (When I switch the language to Japanese, I expect to hear and see exactly what I chose, not the retarded dialect of english.)
[hr][/hr]

With all being stated, my experience wasn't pleasant, even with friends (more like the game ""wanted"" for it to be unpleasant), and terrible in solos, since it just refuses to properly respond to 80% of my input in one way or another. Even when it does respond, I still encounter the issues I listed above way too often. 
It's like the developers thought, ""Huh... we don't have chimps in this game... so let's try our best to compensate that in any other way!"" It definitely has way more potential than what it shows right now, but the developers really don't seem to want to work with that despite making updates. At the end of it, once in a while, I just report anyone, even friends, just to make sure that the developers don't forget that they're ""retarded imbeciles"" and other reasonable names that they're 100% proud to be known as. 

The game becomes just bearable when playing with friends, and that's as far as it goes."

However now all of the classes have readily available gadgets/skills to do the supposed job of the other two.

The game is fun, and I have enjoyed my time with it. If this game seems appealing to you, it will probably be quite fun.
But the Barrier...
TLDR: The devs have expressed concern about the high financial barrier to entry. They are not working on lowering the financial barrier, and instead create it to prey upon new players. Take your money somewhere where you and your worth are respected.

[i] I live in Canada and will be talking about Canadian prices and price trends. [/i]

At the time of writing, the devs have recently released a subscription model for the DLC in the game. This is not inherently a bad thing, despite what you may see in discussions. The subscription is made for new players, as stated by the dev diary #334. If you will allow me to be hyperbolic, financial barriers are made up, as this digital game could be given away for free, and it would not bankrupt paradox games. obviously that is not an effective way to continue to develop games, but the core concept is there, if the game is too expensive to play, are the devs working on ways to make it cheaper to enjoy? After a while trawling through steam databases, I can see two pieces of evidence pointing to the fact that they are not working to make the game easier to buy, and one pointing to some small efforts to help you the new player. 

The part helping new players:
Over time, the stellaris DLC's have taken longer and longer to begin to go on sale, and take even longer to reach a sale of 50%. This has changed in the last few DLC. I will use the toxoids DLC as my benchmark because that is when I feel as though the sentiment towards the DLC started to shift. The average time to go on sale for 20%, for Toxoids and the two DLC that came out before it, was 379 days. For the astral planes DLC and the two DLCs before, it took 209 days. This is a major break in the pattern of sales for stellaris. You can say I cherry picked, but I can send you my spreadsheets and graphs, this is a distinct break in the norm.
This allows players to enjoy content that may have attracted you to the game, cheaper or quicker. Additionally the game is very balanced around the presense of the DLC, and playing with all the DLC is assumed by all the stellaris media you will find. Having the recent DLC reach its maximum discount quicker allows for more people to play the primary stellaris experience.

But the two things that are hurting new players:
1. The price of the most recent DLCs are far higher than equivalent DLC that came before. The First contact story pack DLC is currently $19.99 CDN, every other story pack is $13.99 CDN. The new DLC costs more in a way completely incongruous with the entire history of the price trends of every piece of DLC in this game. There is no reason for this cost, and if it was to be more in line with long term pricing that the other DLC will catch up to when...
2. There have been three price increases for stellaris DLC in Canada in the last two years. The game costs more because of more DLC, but also every single one of those DLC has become harder to buy. The necroid DLC is the prime example of this, as it has increased from $8.99 CDN to $13.99 CDN. Necroids costs 55% more to buy right now, compared to when it was released. You can argue that they have added content to the DLC, but you could buy it at it's original price with all the new content included for a time, and even then they increased the price $1 after adding content, the other $4 had no reason to occur. The exact game and DLC I bought will cost YOU more to buy, let alone the DLC released since then.

The financial barrier of entry to this game is growing. The logical reason is that it is always gaining new DLC, and so there is more to buy, but the cost of the SAME game is increasing, and the new DLC costs more then equivalent DLC, while also having the same price increases. the price changes are far beyond inflation in Canada, there is no reason for this gouging of our wallets.

And so, Paradox created the expansion subscription. An easy solution to this[i] mysterious [/i]problem of a financial barrier that has appeared from [strike]greed[/strike] the slow growth of the library of DLC you should buy. What if you didn't own the DLC, but paid each month for a rental. Stellar idea. Case closed. See you next month.

Paradox does not care about the barrier to entry, they made it, and continue to make it today.
Paradox is hiding behind caring for new players, while bleeding their wallets dry.
YOU should not buy this game.
Find a developer that is happy to provide joy, and only asks for as much as they need to keep making the games they love."
76561198045785308,281990,False,0.607451975345611572,"Please note - this review is not being made in protest to the new subscription DLC model added to the game - while I have my own opinions on it and agree with most people, more than enough have already said their peace. Instead this review focuses on the game as a whole, not Paradox's poor business sense.

Be warned, this review is long.

Stellaris used to be good. Key word, ""used to."" I've not played the game during launch, nor do I own it on console, so I've not experienced the game early in its design ethos back when there were multiple beginner choices for FTL and weapons focus at the beginning of the games. I have, however, been playing the game since as far back as before Distant Stars, and have thoroughly enjoyed my time with it. I have clocked well over 2000 hours playing this title, and have played largely casually in singleplayer, vanilla and modded, and I am one of those players who has had 0 achievements despite all the hours I've played - more than enough time to know that some of the decisions Paradox has made surrounding this game's IP has been weird to say the least.

So why the negative review? Because the devs keep changing things in ways I don't like. Yeah, the DLCs add feature bloat, I won't deny that, but I've only played as high up as Nemesis and Toxoids and haven't had real reason to want to go further down the rabbit hole. In that amount of time since I've seen the devs decide to take this game in multiple different directions, ultimately forgetting the core reason why this game was fun to begin with - the fact that this game doesn't and never needed a singular IP focus. Unlike countless other 4X titles, Stellaris isn't about playing a grand strategy game in an established universe - it's about making a unique civ in a unique universe with unique or pre-spawned peoples. You're given a list of cool choices to play unique starfaring peoples across the galaxy, ranging from bog-standard generic United Nations of Earth to lost Earthbound colonists seeking their own survival in a galaxy of terrors, to the Galactic Federation of Trekkind to Legally Distinct Imperium of Man, and so many more. Even with just the base game you can do so much customizing to make unique playthroughs and storytelling from start to finish, though with mods the possibilities become endless - I once played a civ inspired by the cockroaches from Wall-E, having evolved on an abandoned Earth with several other civilizations of post-Earth exiles all wanting their rightful home. 

Over the last few years the devs have released a series of updates that have made ""make your own civilization in its own galaxy"" increasingly difficult to downright impossible, simply because new in-game features baked in have restricted those desires. This is largely in part to the devs being dissatisfied with the allocation of some resources, but in large part has also expressed some of their internal politics (I'll get to that in a minute). The biggest one for me is Admin Sprawl - what determines how big your civ can be before you literally have to engulf huge swathes of the galaxy just to make ends meet to reach end-game tech. At one point Admin Sprawl was a harsh reality that could only be expaneded via percentages - a civic could increase it slightly, followed by an ascension perk, followed by a small series of tech upgrades. In-lore they were established as being an advanced form of FTL communications so bureaucrats could properly allocate resources. This meant that big empires (including AI ones) get a debuff the bigger they are, which allowed for players to develop unique strategies like ""Playing Tall."" By focusing on a smaller system region and planets you could effectively use your pops to tech boost yourself to end-game miles ahead of the AI, and while gamey it opened up many unique opportunities for play. The two worst updates to come to the game added bureaucrat pop jobs which effectively eliminated sprawl altogether (whole planets could be dedicated just to extending the sprawl cap), to then turning admin sprawl into a very light slap on the wrist that you eventually grow numb to, which meant that playing tall was no longer possible - the AI, which can ignore this slap, can now outright ignore the debuff that formerly crippled it, meaning if you don't expand and become big outright the AI *will* bully you even at lower difficulties. Even on Cadet, the original easy mode (before they added Games Journalist friendly mode, aka Civilian), your AI neighbors will do their darnedest to utterly T-bag you into submission even when they're supposed to be the good guys (you know the game's bullying you when Peaceful Traders, a Pacifist civ, are the ones declaring war on you 5 times in one game).

The other change is leader upkeep. Originally you could buy leaders using the in-game primary currency used to represent money - Energy Credits. A gamey thing some people would do is if a leader appeared in the pool of three available that they didn't want, they'd buy some up to clear the pool, fire them, and wait until they get someone they want (I never did, I'd just buy whoever fit and use them regardless, but that's besides the point). When updating the game to make the Unity resource much more useful, they changed leaders so that they required this resource not only to purchase but to upkeep them. Unity effectively to me is ""Populace Societal Zeitgeist"", a representation of the fanciful philosophical ideals of your populace as a resource that can be gathered and spent. The idea was that to hire your leader to what was effectively your cabinet required you to literally pick them up off the street from jobs they were otherwise needed and where they were still wanted...which is a massive slap to the face to anybody playing a corporation, egalitarian, or any non-Stalinist civilization you wanted to make. And likewise makes zero sense, especially with the Paragons update that gives them fanciful backstories that have zero gameplay impact (fairly sure the mining guilds can hire another miner to replace the one I assigned to govern their planet). Even with the new leader system effectively crippling your leader pool that forces a player to play faux-tall, this system is complete garbage and wrecks the previously-established freedom of choice that the game once touted for its civs, and exists solely to drain a resouce that could be completely removed from the game with no negative consequence.

I think the latest update, Eridanus, ultimately is the straw that breaks the camel's back for me. Whether it was meant to streamline systems or not, several techs that were established in the game and used as handy markers to determine whether or not a player can advance a certain direction in the three tech trees in the game have been removed, ultimately without warning or telling the player ahead of time, and I have noted that several archeology sites that can sometimes provide those techs in previous saves *still* add them and can cause your game to crash because the game doesn't realize those techs don't exist anymore. Granted, the game I was running was heavily modded *and* a save from before the update, but the removal of these techs has fundamentally broken much of the gameplay flow and is likely resulting in several other crashes I've experienced following it. This is coming from someone who can no longer play his favorite mods like the Gigastructures mod because the amount of feature bloat has caused the game to not only take forever to load on startup, but fill all available RAM on my PC (16 gig), when not even a year ago it did not have these problems. This, combined with already established issues such as the incredibly awful pop slowdowns in the game where by midgame your PC slows to a crawl because the game is tracking every single pop, has made the game unplayable.

TL:DR - used to be good, devs changed it, variety has become an illusion.

- Looks menacing and complex but it's easy to master. 

Con.
- Mid to end-game turns into a confusing micro management mess.
- There is no end game. You survive the crisis, become one, get bored and quit before the final year comes, or just quit because the game performance becomes too bad. 
- Ai cheats like it's the 2000's, compensating for being dumb. Your allies support the AI enemies a lot of times. Galactic voting for ex is blatantly so. 
- Easily exploitable gameplay.
- Like ALL Paradox games of this type, it becomes boring and repetitive after the early game.
- Paradox scams you. Less content and quality with each DLC, but more expensive. Shrinkflation in games is offensive and you should punish them with your wallet.  If you go to the grocery store and start getting less quality and quantity for more money, you are not happy. Why is this any different?
- Balancing is a gamble. The devs might change the game for the better in incredible ways, or fuck it up and ruin it in perpetuity. But you already paid for it and you can't stop auto-updates! HAHAHAHA
- Subscription play. Because nothing becomes cheaper once the price goes up, not even scams! Now they give you the opportunity to rent the game if you can't afford it. Milk the dlc scam less or price them accordingly to value/content? Hell no, this is Paradox! You will own nothing and be happy.
- Prohibitive price. You can get the base game for an ok price, get hooked, and feel incomplete. Solution for your addiction is paying more. Full game goes over 100$ easily while on sale. The non sale price is just a joke. Paradox will make a DLC for a new skin and sell it for 14.99$ if they can. 

The game follows the Paradox classic formula. They are all basically the same with different setups and look. It's very good for what it does, but also milked and priced in the extreme if you want the full experience. Most of the content is locked behind paywall. This is not a luxury product, you shouldn't have to chip in with all your friends to afford only 1 full game so you can all play a complete ed. I got the full game as a present, but even if I like Paradox games, they are always at the end of my wishlist because of the price and the sheer number of dlc's. If I split the complete game between sales or according to budget, it's the same effort like buying multiple full games. Chose to pay a hefty price for DLC's or enjoy a basic samey 4x/grand strategy. And on top of that there is always the chance that they will ruin the game with bad updates and you can't stop auto-update and end up having paid a lot for nothing! It hurts because I feel like I am not reviewing the game but the publisher, but you get more fun for less $ from other games. Their marketing formula is giving you awesome content drop by drop to scratch the need, but now they just push trash for more money! Paradox games are literally an expensive and risky investment.

A lot of the negative reviews surrounding this game are about price and I understand that this game is expensive but it's a niche game with constant free updates that these DLC essentially pay for.

installed: 2TB Samsung SSD

I also use a UW 144hz monitor at 3440p x 1440p

I read online that the game has had many patches and works perfectly fine now with some minor lag in rather densely populated/particles areas. So I gave it a shot.

I start the first 10 mins walking prologue. about 8 of those 10 mins the game was stuttering.

76561198016432154,1774580,False,0.536571681499481201,"Okay, wanna laugh ? I'll humor you.

I was hesitating to get this for a long time. But now, it's clearly Respawn doesnt care about anything, except money and most likely no further performance improvements, patches will come. Hence I decided to give it a go.

Right away even before launch (but then re applied, cuz game was configuring smth, shader caching or idk, oh and it's on every launch) I've downloaded MayThePerformanceBeWithYou mod from Nexus. I have RTX 2060. During cutscene FPS jumped here and there from 50 to 120. During gameplay everything was okay on Medium settings. Had ~70+ FPS. But I've heard first are is somewhat okay, problems and crashes should come later. Idk about that, I've already asked for a refund.

Why ? There's a fun thing. Patch for EA Desktop App from January or February completely broke Steam Overlay injection. This means:
- firstly and most importantly - your controller may not work without additional tricks. I've tried with Dual Sense and had no luck until I've added EA App to Steam and launched it from Steam;
- no Overlay functions, i.e. chats, notes, guides, etc
- issues with Achievements/Trophies. Some users said that there's no pop up, but trophy is obtained. It was true in Fallen Order for me (I bought it long time ago with huge discount, completed even earlier via 1$ EA Play sub along with Andromeda =P) and revisited recently for achievements. Back then overlay was working alright.

Sorry, just got distracted. Other folks reported that they specifically went for trophy they didnt had, completed requirements for unlock, checked Steam, restarted Steam - no trophy. Same reports in Mass Effect community.

I like Star Wars very much so decided to check for workaround and google a bit (hour or more :D). Tried to install old Origin app an wanted to patch it with F Off EA App dll from Github, but Origin installer says I have no connection thus it cant be installed.

Then I went to..I dunno how to call it. EA, for the lack of the better word, almost completely ""ditched"" customer support and now it's more like Community Support with some allegedly EA employees poping out here and there. What a circus that is. You can check it here:
https://answers.ea.com/t5/STAR-WARS-Jedi-Survivor-/Steam-Input-and-Overlay-Not-working-in-Jedi-Survivor/td-p/13404814

Topic was created January 17th. EA community manager shows on page 2. Later he requests some information from affected customers. 2 months (!!!!!!!!) later - silence. Issues still here.

This is fraud. Shame that Valve doesn't care.

Imagine amount of happy faces if EA and Ubi announces Steam versions of their games no longer require their poor apps.

If you wanna put up with all this crap and give those people your money - it's your call.

In any case I wish you all best and May The Force Be With You."

I quit with MW@ due to the ridiculous gameplay, flashy weapon skins, and continued hacking in MP. The franchise has concentrated toooooo much on warzone-free to play, and almost no attention to those of us that actually buy the core game. Im sick of the interface and continually prompting me to play warzone. Why do i want to jump in to a game full of hackers, waist my time to get killed and then have to find another server and start over.  The only reason i got MW3 was for zombies alone. Well, I halfway regret that. The gameplay is ""ok"" but there are random server crashes, get kicked out, and lose everything you have built up and acquired through previous gameplay. I loved the previous zombies open world. This however, sucks... You are on a timer and unless you are in a party-(3 by default,) with the same objective, you can accomplish nothing you need to unless you go off on your own. Going off on your own in itself makes what you can accomplish limited due to time restriction and inability to ""rank up"" to what you need to accomplish goals. I played a few rounds of regular multiplayer only to immediately be placed in a game full of aim bot and wall hacks. I really hoped that they would take the infamous and dumb bunny hopping away, but they have not. I am sure that after this game/iteration i will not be buying any more COD. I have given it years to fix itself and they have not. Bring back dedicated servers, do away with warzone, give us a zombies that it playable with ability to actually extract and save more than what is current, give achievable unlocks that do not require 3 players to achieve, actually fix the hacking in MP, do away with some of the gimmicky bs and build a actual good game. This use to be the top of the line FPS with a historical context and real life basis. Now, shoot a zombie with an M@ 50 cal and cant kill, but a pack a punched 9mm handgun willl 1 shot kill the same. I mean really??? who makes this sh!+ up... And also for zombies, they must have arms that are 10 feet long bc they can reach and hit you from behind and never be remotely close to you. I think i am done with the COD franchise after MW@, MW3 and the last blackops. They did at least listen and got somewhat back to traditional vs blackops and the stupid suits...They just kept everything else that has been wrong for years. You would think that they would listen to their paying customers and not the leeching hackers playing warzone on what the game should/could be... BTW, the campaign absolutely sucks. IT is not a campaign but mini missions such adds in raid...that was a stupid idea also."

But FH4 is designed to be a largely multiplayer game, and this is where things fall apart. Perhaps this is due to its age, but the whole multiplayer component is just atrocious. I don't think the way it's designed in general is very good to begin with, but good luck even getting to experience that properly - every race is a 50-50 chance of getting softlocked on one of the game's numerous showcase/result screens and having all your progress undone. The netcode is visibly falling apart in front of your eyes most of the time. And in their infinite wisdom, Microsoft decided there's no need to include an option to mute other players, so if someone in your lobby leaves their mic on, have fun listening to their kids screeching in a foreign language for the next 15 minutes.

While I liked the playable characters well enough and had some heartfelt story moments with them, the game fell flat for me on almost all of the social links. They ranged from unlikable (Moon, Emperor, Devil), over tired old anime ""ganbatte kudasai"" (Strength, Star, Chariot) or ""notice me senpai"" (Justice) storylines, past boring (Hierophant) to downright bizarre (Magician, Hermit).

Gameplay became a slog around November in-game-time, since there is very little happening to keep the gameplay interesting over time. It's all just randomly generated floors made of 10-12 tiles from floors 2-250.
Once you arrive at the top-level personas for each Arcana there is not much more happening to keep Fusions interesting.

I played the game in Hard Mode at first because I thought it would be a more engaging challenge, but I found that it just made the later bosses or strong shadows damage sponges that sometimes took 5-6 All-out Attacks to bring down, without making the fight itself more interesting.

Persona 4 Golden is the game you want to play when you‚Äôre feeling homesick.
Persona 3 Reload is the game you want to play when you‚Äôre numb and want to feel something.

This game is far from perfect. There was  the tone of dread present in every version of Persona 3, including the animation, which is missing from this game. The darker atmosphere and cinematography was dropped in favor for a more dynamic one. This is most prevalent in the MC‚Äôs persona awakening. I think the Original did the scene the best.

Despite my issue with the tone, I still think this is my favorite interpretation of Persona 3. My main, non spoiler related feature is that Direct Control exists and is on by default. Theurgies allow for fun, unique cinematics which can dish out some nice damage, provide debuffs, and/or buffs. 

Besides gameplay, I think this game does the best in certain scenes compared to its previous incarnations. Without going into specifics, I have felt more emotionally drained in this game compared to FES. The main reason being someone‚Äôs specific theurgy being absolutely gut wrenching.

It‚Äôs late at night, just finished my playthrough of this game, will probably edit it later.

76561199099388059,2161700,True,0.502702713012695313,I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS!
76561198037089395,2161700,False,0.5,"I can't recommend this game. It's long, tedious and I think for the amount of time you need to invest in it, a lot of it is just busywork that I personally (ha) didn‚Äôt really enjoy at all. The story just isn‚Äôt good enough to carry it.

Starting with how the Tartarus is very tedious rng room collection that doesn't really link to anything, even the themes of floors seem largely random. The game frontloads most of the social links in 'after school' schedule with only two of them being available in the evening. Very often (in particular during exams) you are given this animation of the time advancing to next day and it happens over and over and it is very tedious, honestly.

A lot of this game is just that: tedium.

Now to go point by point:

The plot is... okay. I don't particularly think it's the best thing since sliced bread. Personally enjoyed 5 more. After being told how 'amazing' the writing is and how it was so much better than anything else, I was very disappointed. It's actually really... not that amazing. It's a by the book 'teenagers save the world through power of friendship' story. And while I‚Äôd argue Persona 5 is the same thing, the themes it tackled resonated more with me. Here, in 3, there's nothing new or fresh about it, besides the theme of 'death' and 'accepting death', which wasn't really tackled with any amount of depth to it. Maybe when this game came out first, 20 years ago, this was revolutionary, and I do think it might have been the case. But now, the writing really shows its age. (there are also some REALLY concerning dubious and frankly worrisome themes of teacher or adult /student relationships that always concern me in these games. It was pretty ick in 5 and it‚Äôs even worse here).

The social links are okay but a lot of them are just downright creepy (really feel like the protagonist should be on some watch list for the hanged man one, and the chariot one is awful too. Some others like Hermit are kind of just creepy. Some are wholesome, though, like the Hierophant or the Sun.) Again, I was always told persona 3 was better than sliced bread, but I was solely disappointed there. Perhaps if I didn‚Äôt go in expecting brilliance I would  have enjoyed them more, but as is, I‚Äôm disappointed.

You can't actually interact with it much, either. (dialogue choices are there but they are inconsequential). Even  if you choose to engage in some stories romantically, that choice has absolutely no impact and the dialogue doesn't change outside  of specific interactions with that one person.

The ending is fine, it's again nothing spectacular. I will definitely not be buying the DLC however.

The combat is fine. It's persona. I miss baton pass mechanic from 5 though. Having a clever full-party rotation to beat added a layer to combat that this game's one really kind of lacks. The game is very generous with the amount of items you get, and with the gear. I really wish the boxes you need the twilight items for didn't hold cosmetics however, because I never  use them and having spent 3 stones on unlocking a box for a character who was no longer around was the most vibrant 'fuck you' the game  could give me. It actually made me reload.

Music is the only thing that I adored. Amazing vibes.

The gameplay, although a little annoying at times, keeps itself interesting and simple. I've been addicted to this game ever since I was 8 years old, and it affected a major part of my child hood. The game itself isn't too hard, (although you can increase and decrease it's difficulty!) but is a little bit complicated. I can also definitely tell the dev's didn't take this game too seriously with its silly references, enemy and boss concepts, and just generally a goofy take at some pixel art. For $10, this game is a steal. I still haven't fully completed 100% of the achievements on my steam account despite having over 500 hours in the game. Very replayable, with a ton of secret worlds and easter eggs to discover.

Developed by Round 8 Studio, this game showcases the studio's potential for delivering captivating gameplay and engaging narratives.

One of the standout features is the games compelling story, which manages to be both good and entertaining. Unlike many games in the genre that rely solely on gameplay, Lies of P incorporates a rich narrative that adds depth to the overall experience.

The progression system, notably the P-organ mechanic, adds a refreshing layer to character development. The inclusion of new upgrades in NG+ and NG++ incentivizes multiple playthroughs, keeping the gameplay experience fresh and exciting.

Additionally, the weapon system introduces a unique twist, allowing players to experiment with various weapons. While I found myself gravitating towards specific weapons like the Wintry Rapier, Two Dragons Sword, or Proof of Humanity, the system offers ample room for exploration.

Visually, ""Lies of P"" is a treat for the eyes, boasting beautiful aesthetics and a charming art style that enhances the overall immersion.

However, the game isn't without its flaws. The level design, while serviceable, fails to stand out, and the dodge mechanic often feels underwhelming. Furthermore, the parry window can be punishingly short, detracting from the otherwise satisfying combat system.

Boss fights, while challenging, suffer from awkward timings and animations, which can lead to frustrating encounters.

76561197973580399,1364780,True,0.894174635410308838,"As a core product, Street Fighter 6 is a triumph.  Capcom took years of feedback about what did and didn't work through the Street Fighter 5 era, listened and adapted.  The product is polished to a mirror sheen.  As a fighting game, the systems are really well thought out, work together, and provide for a fantastic fighting experience that can be picked up easily enough but have significant depth to them.   The roster is diverse, reasonably sized, and has enough variety that you can find someone that you'll like playing.  The newcomers in particular landed incredibly well, with designs like Marisa, Manon and Kimberly being instantly iconic and full of personality.  The online experience, critical for a modern day fighting title, is also superb, with fantastic rollback netcode, plenty of features, a sensibly balanced ranked ladder, good matchmaking, and quick load times.  It's easy to load up SF6, play a bunch of online rounds, and feel like you got a great gaming experience.

Capcom also did a very savvy thing, centering the experience around two overlapping tentpoles; World Tour mode and Modern controls.  World Tour is effectively what a big budget beat-em-up would look like in the modern era - roaming around some open world maps, getting into fights, getting money and experience and cosmetics to dress up your (extremely customizable and potentially grotesquely deformed) avatar.  All the while, you're interacting with the SF6 roster, learning their styles, mixing and matching moves, and getting to know them as characters outside of the fighting arena.  It's part extended mechanics tutorial, part street brawl, and really quite a lot of fun.  It also plays extremely well with Modern controls, which is a fully usable control scheme that cuts the execution requirements from the traditional 6 button technical input scheme to a four button version that includes some simple auto-combos and one-button specials.  While purists might get snobby about it, Modern does exactly what it sets out to do - lets less experienced players be competitive in versus matches, and shift the focus from technical control inputs to the more important strategic layer of movement, positioning, traps, and mindgames, which is where fighting games shine.

All this said, SF6 is being tremendously let down and hurt by some very questionable ongoing development and business decisions.  The game itself, outside of the traditional season pass DLC characters we have so far (two of them released, two announced), has been stagnating in a way that some of its contemporaries are not; Capcom has elected to go with an annual balance patch, which means the meta hasn't really shifted since launch and characters with glaring weaknesses in their kit remain undertuned and underrepresented.  Ongoing content releases have mostly been focused on avatar cosmetics and other items that can't be used or show up outside of gimmick avatar battles.  Most of these come through the now-obligatory premium battlepasses; while the paid tracks ultimately can be self-sustaining if you play enough matches, they cycle extremely quickly and turn SF6 into the grindy type of live service experience.  Capcom also has gotten into using predatory micro and macrotransaction practices, using a combination of secondary mobile-style currencies (sold in bundles that never quite fit right, of course) and extremely overpriced premium cosmetics (fifteen dollar TMNT costumes, anyone?  fifteen dollars per turtle, that is).  This culminated in the long awaited Outfit 3 release, with new costumes for the whole roster - a breath of fresh air for a stagnating visual experience marred by the costumes being expensive (six dollars each), not available in any sort of bulk bundle, and only available using Capcom's secondary currency.  There is no world in which it can be considered justifiable to have to pay over 100 dollars for a roster-wide single outfit update, even if they were available a-la carte and are very high quality designs.

So, SF6.  I do recommend it if you like or want to like fighting games, because it's really a great 2D fighter. That said, if you are sensitive to or put off by some of the gaming industry's worst practices, they're showing up in full force here and there's no real indication that Capcom is listening to player feedback on the subject.  It's certainly killed a lot of my drive to follow and play the game on an ongoing fashion, and I have to note it as a real black eye on the experience."

Firstly, this game looks amazing and the World Tour is a nice little distraction.  The alt control types are very accessible, speaking from experience as my gf has carpal tunnel and she appreciates the options.

But the monetization for this game is buns.  Actively infuriating.  Full price FG with a season pass is already asking for 90 out the gate, at the very least this game released at 60.
But a BATTLE PASS with the jukebox items locked behind it that they advertised would be a FREE feature that would work similar to Tekken or even it's own in the PREVIOUS GAME in the franchise on top of the Cosume fiasco and the avatar custom stuff has me telling you to skip off of principle.  If none of that matters to you, feel free to scoop this when it's like $20 or sumn, but your best bet is to wait for the inevitable complete edition bundle 5 years from now rather than letting Capcom grift you.

I've been policed for ""quitting ranked games"" when the match had ended and was on the ""return to lobby screen"" when I disconnected from the game.

1: Microtransactions that are very anti consumer.

The cheapest FC only has a quantity 250 FC. So you either buy the cheapest twice or go with the next tier which have a quantity of 610 FC. Basically you're either short of a little FC or you have too much left.

2: Cheaters/Script users especially in platinum 5 to high master rank. You know its real when pro players such as Fchamp is literally hunting these mfers and posting the videos on his youtube channel.

76561199470403856,1364780,True,0.509803950786590576,One word: Juri
76561197973580399,1364780,True,0.894174635410308838,"As a core product, Street Fighter 6 is a triumph.  Capcom took years of feedback about what did and didn't work through the Street Fighter 5 era, listened and adapted.  The product is polished to a mirror sheen.  As a fighting game, the systems are really well thought out, work together, and provide for a fantastic fighting experience that can be picked up easily enough but have significant depth to them.   The roster is diverse, reasonably sized, and has enough variety that you can find someone that you'll like playing.  The newcomers in particular landed incredibly well, with designs like Marisa, Manon and Kimberly being instantly iconic and full of personality.  The online experience, critical for a modern day fighting title, is also superb, with fantastic rollback netcode, plenty of features, a sensibly balanced ranked ladder, good matchmaking, and quick load times.  It's easy to load up SF6, play a bunch of online rounds, and feel like you got a great gaming experience.

Capcom also did a very savvy thing, centering the experience around two overlapping tentpoles; World Tour mode and Modern controls.  World Tour is effectively what a big budget beat-em-up would look like in the modern era - roaming around some open world maps, getting into fights, getting money and experience and cosmetics to dress up your (extremely customizable and potentially grotesquely deformed) avatar.  All the while, you're interacting with the SF6 roster, learning their styles, mixing and matching moves, and getting to know them as characters outside of the fighting arena.  It's part extended mechanics tutorial, part street brawl, and really quite a lot of fun.  It also plays extremely well with Modern controls, which is a fully usable control scheme that cuts the execution requirements from the traditional 6 button technical input scheme to a four button version that includes some simple auto-combos and one-button specials.  While purists might get snobby about it, Modern does exactly what it sets out to do - lets less experienced players be competitive in versus matches, and shift the focus from technical control inputs to the more important strategic layer of movement, positioning, traps, and mindgames, which is where fighting games shine.

All this said, SF6 is being tremendously let down and hurt by some very questionable ongoing development and business decisions.  The game itself, outside of the traditional season pass DLC characters we have so far (two of them released, two announced), has been stagnating in a way that some of its contemporaries are not; Capcom has elected to go with an annual balance patch, which means the meta hasn't really shifted since launch and characters with glaring weaknesses in their kit remain undertuned and underrepresented.  Ongoing content releases have mostly been focused on avatar cosmetics and other items that can't be used or show up outside of gimmick avatar battles.  Most of these come through the now-obligatory premium battlepasses; while the paid tracks ultimately can be self-sustaining if you play enough matches, they cycle extremely quickly and turn SF6 into the grindy type of live service experience.  Capcom also has gotten into using predatory micro and macrotransaction practices, using a combination of secondary mobile-style currencies (sold in bundles that never quite fit right, of course) and extremely overpriced premium cosmetics (fifteen dollar TMNT costumes, anyone?  fifteen dollars per turtle, that is).  This culminated in the long awaited Outfit 3 release, with new costumes for the whole roster - a breath of fresh air for a stagnating visual experience marred by the costumes being expensive (six dollars each), not available in any sort of bulk bundle, and only available using Capcom's secondary currency.  There is no world in which it can be considered justifiable to have to pay over 100 dollars for a roster-wide single outfit update, even if they were available a-la carte and are very high quality designs.

So, SF6.  I do recommend it if you like or want to like fighting games, because it's really a great 2D fighter. That said, if you are sensitive to or put off by some of the gaming industry's worst practices, they're showing up in full force here and there's no real indication that Capcom is listening to player feedback on the subject.  It's certainly killed a lot of my drive to follow and play the game on an ongoing fashion, and I have to note it as a real black eye on the experience."

Firstly, this game looks amazing and the World Tour is a nice little distraction.  The alt control types are very accessible, speaking from experience as my gf has carpal tunnel and she appreciates the options.

But the monetization for this game is buns.  Actively infuriating.  Full price FG with a season pass is already asking for 90 out the gate, at the very least this game released at 60.
But a BATTLE PASS with the jukebox items locked behind it that they advertised would be a FREE feature that would work similar to Tekken or even it's own in the PREVIOUS GAME in the franchise on top of the Cosume fiasco and the avatar custom stuff has me telling you to skip off of principle.  If none of that matters to you, feel free to scoop this when it's like $20 or sumn, but your best bet is to wait for the inevitable complete edition bundle 5 years from now rather than letting Capcom grift you.

76561197973580399,1364780,True,0.894174635410308838,"As a core product, Street Fighter 6 is a triumph.  Capcom took years of feedback about what did and didn't work through the Street Fighter 5 era, listened and adapted.  The product is polished to a mirror sheen.  As a fighting game, the systems are really well thought out, work together, and provide for a fantastic fighting experience that can be picked up easily enough but have significant depth to them.   The roster is diverse, reasonably sized, and has enough variety that you can find someone that you'll like playing.  The newcomers in particular landed incredibly well, with designs like Marisa, Manon and Kimberly being instantly iconic and full of personality.  The online experience, critical for a modern day fighting title, is also superb, with fantastic rollback netcode, plenty of features, a sensibly balanced ranked ladder, good matchmaking, and quick load times.  It's easy to load up SF6, play a bunch of online rounds, and feel like you got a great gaming experience.

Capcom also did a very savvy thing, centering the experience around two overlapping tentpoles; World Tour mode and Modern controls.  World Tour is effectively what a big budget beat-em-up would look like in the modern era - roaming around some open world maps, getting into fights, getting money and experience and cosmetics to dress up your (extremely customizable and potentially grotesquely deformed) avatar.  All the while, you're interacting with the SF6 roster, learning their styles, mixing and matching moves, and getting to know them as characters outside of the fighting arena.  It's part extended mechanics tutorial, part street brawl, and really quite a lot of fun.  It also plays extremely well with Modern controls, which is a fully usable control scheme that cuts the execution requirements from the traditional 6 button technical input scheme to a four button version that includes some simple auto-combos and one-button specials.  While purists might get snobby about it, Modern does exactly what it sets out to do - lets less experienced players be competitive in versus matches, and shift the focus from technical control inputs to the more important strategic layer of movement, positioning, traps, and mindgames, which is where fighting games shine.

All this said, SF6 is being tremendously let down and hurt by some very questionable ongoing development and business decisions.  The game itself, outside of the traditional season pass DLC characters we have so far (two of them released, two announced), has been stagnating in a way that some of its contemporaries are not; Capcom has elected to go with an annual balance patch, which means the meta hasn't really shifted since launch and characters with glaring weaknesses in their kit remain undertuned and underrepresented.  Ongoing content releases have mostly been focused on avatar cosmetics and other items that can't be used or show up outside of gimmick avatar battles.  Most of these come through the now-obligatory premium battlepasses; while the paid tracks ultimately can be self-sustaining if you play enough matches, they cycle extremely quickly and turn SF6 into the grindy type of live service experience.  Capcom also has gotten into using predatory micro and macrotransaction practices, using a combination of secondary mobile-style currencies (sold in bundles that never quite fit right, of course) and extremely overpriced premium cosmetics (fifteen dollar TMNT costumes, anyone?  fifteen dollars per turtle, that is).  This culminated in the long awaited Outfit 3 release, with new costumes for the whole roster - a breath of fresh air for a stagnating visual experience marred by the costumes being expensive (six dollars each), not available in any sort of bulk bundle, and only available using Capcom's secondary currency.  There is no world in which it can be considered justifiable to have to pay over 100 dollars for a roster-wide single outfit update, even if they were available a-la carte and are very high quality designs.

So, SF6.  I do recommend it if you like or want to like fighting games, because it's really a great 2D fighter. That said, if you are sensitive to or put off by some of the gaming industry's worst practices, they're showing up in full force here and there's no real indication that Capcom is listening to player feedback on the subject.  It's certainly killed a lot of my drive to follow and play the game on an ongoing fashion, and I have to note it as a real black eye on the experience."

Firstly, this game looks amazing and the World Tour is a nice little distraction.  The alt control types are very accessible, speaking from experience as my gf has carpal tunnel and she appreciates the options.

But the monetization for this game is buns.  Actively infuriating.  Full price FG with a season pass is already asking for 90 out the gate, at the very least this game released at 60.
But a BATTLE PASS with the jukebox items locked behind it that they advertised would be a FREE feature that would work similar to Tekken or even it's own in the PREVIOUS GAME in the franchise on top of the Cosume fiasco and the avatar custom stuff has me telling you to skip off of principle.  If none of that matters to you, feel free to scoop this when it's like $20 or sumn, but your best bet is to wait for the inevitable complete edition bundle 5 years from now rather than letting Capcom grift you.

Character designs are cool, but implementing baby mode AND permitting its use in ranked is an absolute travesty. SF6 does not have the same technical complexity as Tekken, and does not warrant the use of one-button special moves. Additionally, the online matchmaking is spotty at best. I've been policed for ""quitting ranked games"" when the match had ended and was on the ""return to lobby screen"" when I disconnected from the game.

1: Microtransactions that are very anti consumer. You can't buy any DLC directly from the steam store, you need to buy fighter coins (premium currency) but the issue is all DLC costume/character is 300-350 FC. The cheapest FC only has a quantity 250 FC. So you either buy the cheapest twice or go with the next tier which have a quantity of 610 FC. Basically you're either short of a little FC or you have too much left.

2: Cheaters/Script users especially in platinum 5 to high master rank. You know its real when pro players such as Fchamp is literally hunting these mfers and posting the videos on his youtube channel.

76561199470403856,1364780,True,0.509803950786590576,One word: Juri
76561197973580399,1364780,True,0.894174635410308838,"As a core product, Street Fighter 6 is a triumph.  Capcom took years of feedback about what did and didn't work through the Street Fighter 5 era, listened and adapted.  The product is polished to a mirror sheen.  As a fighting game, the systems are really well thought out, work together, and provide for a fantastic fighting experience that can be picked up easily enough but have significant depth to them.   The roster is diverse, reasonably sized, and has enough variety that you can find someone that you'll like playing.  The newcomers in particular landed incredibly well, with designs like Marisa, Manon and Kimberly being instantly iconic and full of personality.  The online experience, critical for a modern day fighting title, is also superb, with fantastic rollback netcode, plenty of features, a sensibly balanced ranked ladder, good matchmaking, and quick load times.  It's easy to load up SF6, play a bunch of online rounds, and feel like you got a great gaming experience.

Capcom also did a very savvy thing, centering the experience around two overlapping tentpoles; World Tour mode and Modern controls.  World Tour is effectively what a big budget beat-em-up would look like in the modern era - roaming around some open world maps, getting into fights, getting money and experience and cosmetics to dress up your (extremely customizable and potentially grotesquely deformed) avatar.  All the while, you're interacting with the SF6 roster, learning their styles, mixing and matching moves, and getting to know them as characters outside of the fighting arena.  It's part extended mechanics tutorial, part street brawl, and really quite a lot of fun.  It also plays extremely well with Modern controls, which is a fully usable control scheme that cuts the execution requirements from the traditional 6 button technical input scheme to a four button version that includes some simple auto-combos and one-button specials.  While purists might get snobby about it, Modern does exactly what it sets out to do - lets less experienced players be competitive in versus matches, and shift the focus from technical control inputs to the more important strategic layer of movement, positioning, traps, and mindgames, which is where fighting games shine.

All this said, SF6 is being tremendously let down and hurt by some very questionable ongoing development and business decisions.  The game itself, outside of the traditional season pass DLC characters we have so far (two of them released, two announced), has been stagnating in a way that some of its contemporaries are not; Capcom has elected to go with an annual balance patch, which means the meta hasn't really shifted since launch and characters with glaring weaknesses in their kit remain undertuned and underrepresented.  Ongoing content releases have mostly been focused on avatar cosmetics and other items that can't be used or show up outside of gimmick avatar battles.  Most of these come through the now-obligatory premium battlepasses; while the paid tracks ultimately can be self-sustaining if you play enough matches, they cycle extremely quickly and turn SF6 into the grindy type of live service experience.  Capcom also has gotten into using predatory micro and macrotransaction practices, using a combination of secondary mobile-style currencies (sold in bundles that never quite fit right, of course) and extremely overpriced premium cosmetics (fifteen dollar TMNT costumes, anyone?  fifteen dollars per turtle, that is).  This culminated in the long awaited Outfit 3 release, with new costumes for the whole roster - a breath of fresh air for a stagnating visual experience marred by the costumes being expensive (six dollars each), not available in any sort of bulk bundle, and only available using Capcom's secondary currency.  There is no world in which it can be considered justifiable to have to pay over 100 dollars for a roster-wide single outfit update, even if they were available a-la carte and are very high quality designs.

So, SF6.  I do recommend it if you like or want to like fighting games, because it's really a great 2D fighter. That said, if you are sensitive to or put off by some of the gaming industry's worst practices, they're showing up in full force here and there's no real indication that Capcom is listening to player feedback on the subject.  It's certainly killed a lot of my drive to follow and play the game on an ongoing fashion, and I have to note it as a real black eye on the experience."

Firstly, this game looks amazing and the World Tour is a nice little distraction.  The alt control types are very accessible, speaking from experience as my gf has carpal tunnel and she appreciates the options.

But the monetization for this game is buns.  Actively infuriating.  Full price FG with a season pass is already asking for 90 out the gate, at the very least this game released at 60.
But a BATTLE PASS with the jukebox items locked behind it that they advertised would be a FREE feature that would work similar to Tekken or even it's own in the PREVIOUS GAME in the franchise on top of the Cosume fiasco and the avatar custom stuff has me telling you to skip off of principle.  If none of that matters to you, feel free to scoop this when it's like $20 or sumn, but your best bet is to wait for the inevitable complete edition bundle 5 years from now rather than letting Capcom grift you.

76561197973580399,1364780,True,0.894174635410308838,"As a core product, Street Fighter 6 is a triumph.  Capcom took years of feedback about what did and didn't work through the Street Fighter 5 era, listened and adapted.  The product is polished to a mirror sheen.  As a fighting game, the systems are really well thought out, work together, and provide for a fantastic fighting experience that can be picked up easily enough but have significant depth to them.   The roster is diverse, reasonably sized, and has enough variety that you can find someone that you'll like playing.  The newcomers in particular landed incredibly well, with designs like Marisa, Manon and Kimberly being instantly iconic and full of personality.  The online experience, critical for a modern day fighting title, is also superb, with fantastic rollback netcode, plenty of features, a sensibly balanced ranked ladder, good matchmaking, and quick load times.  It's easy to load up SF6, play a bunch of online rounds, and feel like you got a great gaming experience.

Capcom also did a very savvy thing, centering the experience around two overlapping tentpoles; World Tour mode and Modern controls.  World Tour is effectively what a big budget beat-em-up would look like in the modern era - roaming around some open world maps, getting into fights, getting money and experience and cosmetics to dress up your (extremely customizable and potentially grotesquely deformed) avatar.  All the while, you're interacting with the SF6 roster, learning their styles, mixing and matching moves, and getting to know them as characters outside of the fighting arena.  It's part extended mechanics tutorial, part street brawl, and really quite a lot of fun.  It also plays extremely well with Modern controls, which is a fully usable control scheme that cuts the execution requirements from the traditional 6 button technical input scheme to a four button version that includes some simple auto-combos and one-button specials.  While purists might get snobby about it, Modern does exactly what it sets out to do - lets less experienced players be competitive in versus matches, and shift the focus from technical control inputs to the more important strategic layer of movement, positioning, traps, and mindgames, which is where fighting games shine.

All this said, SF6 is being tremendously let down and hurt by some very questionable ongoing development and business decisions.  The game itself, outside of the traditional season pass DLC characters we have so far (two of them released, two announced), has been stagnating in a way that some of its contemporaries are not; Capcom has elected to go with an annual balance patch, which means the meta hasn't really shifted since launch and characters with glaring weaknesses in their kit remain undertuned and underrepresented.  Ongoing content releases have mostly been focused on avatar cosmetics and other items that can't be used or show up outside of gimmick avatar battles.  Most of these come through the now-obligatory premium battlepasses; while the paid tracks ultimately can be self-sustaining if you play enough matches, they cycle extremely quickly and turn SF6 into the grindy type of live service experience.  Capcom also has gotten into using predatory micro and macrotransaction practices, using a combination of secondary mobile-style currencies (sold in bundles that never quite fit right, of course) and extremely overpriced premium cosmetics (fifteen dollar TMNT costumes, anyone?  fifteen dollars per turtle, that is).  This culminated in the long awaited Outfit 3 release, with new costumes for the whole roster - a breath of fresh air for a stagnating visual experience marred by the costumes being expensive (six dollars each), not available in any sort of bulk bundle, and only available using Capcom's secondary currency.  There is no world in which it can be considered justifiable to have to pay over 100 dollars for a roster-wide single outfit update, even if they were available a-la carte and are very high quality designs.

So, SF6.  I do recommend it if you like or want to like fighting games, because it's really a great 2D fighter. That said, if you are sensitive to or put off by some of the gaming industry's worst practices, they're showing up in full force here and there's no real indication that Capcom is listening to player feedback on the subject.  It's certainly killed a lot of my drive to follow and play the game on an ongoing fashion, and I have to note it as a real black eye on the experience."

But a BATTLE PASS with the jukebox items locked behind it that they advertised would be a FREE feature that would work similar to Tekken or even it's own in the PREVIOUS GAME in the franchise on top of the Cosume fiasco and the avatar custom stuff has me telling you to skip off of principle.

It takes a while getting used to the strict timings of comboing especially because of the new system that allows for combo extension but once you get a hang of it is a blast to play.
every character has their own charm and feels different to play from the rest of the cast.

I have to say that I do miss the old days when the cast was larger and not every skin and colour were in game purchases but rather unlockable via play time but that seems to be today¬¥s standard.

76561199470403856,1364780,True,0.509803950786590576,One word: Juri
76561197973580399,1364780,True,0.894174635410308838,"As a core product, Street Fighter 6 is a triumph.  Capcom took years of feedback about what did and didn't work through the Street Fighter 5 era, listened and adapted.  The product is polished to a mirror sheen.  As a fighting game, the systems are really well thought out, work together, and provide for a fantastic fighting experience that can be picked up easily enough but have significant depth to them.   The roster is diverse, reasonably sized, and has enough variety that you can find someone that you'll like playing.  The newcomers in particular landed incredibly well, with designs like Marisa, Manon and Kimberly being instantly iconic and full of personality.  The online experience, critical for a modern day fighting title, is also superb, with fantastic rollback netcode, plenty of features, a sensibly balanced ranked ladder, good matchmaking, and quick load times.  It's easy to load up SF6, play a bunch of online rounds, and feel like you got a great gaming experience.

Capcom also did a very savvy thing, centering the experience around two overlapping tentpoles; World Tour mode and Modern controls.  World Tour is effectively what a big budget beat-em-up would look like in the modern era - roaming around some open world maps, getting into fights, getting money and experience and cosmetics to dress up your (extremely customizable and potentially grotesquely deformed) avatar.  All the while, you're interacting with the SF6 roster, learning their styles, mixing and matching moves, and getting to know them as characters outside of the fighting arena.  It's part extended mechanics tutorial, part street brawl, and really quite a lot of fun.  It also plays extremely well with Modern controls, which is a fully usable control scheme that cuts the execution requirements from the traditional 6 button technical input scheme to a four button version that includes some simple auto-combos and one-button specials.  While purists might get snobby about it, Modern does exactly what it sets out to do - lets less experienced players be competitive in versus matches, and shift the focus from technical control inputs to the more important strategic layer of movement, positioning, traps, and mindgames, which is where fighting games shine.

All this said, SF6 is being tremendously let down and hurt by some very questionable ongoing development and business decisions.  The game itself, outside of the traditional season pass DLC characters we have so far (two of them released, two announced), has been stagnating in a way that some of its contemporaries are not; Capcom has elected to go with an annual balance patch, which means the meta hasn't really shifted since launch and characters with glaring weaknesses in their kit remain undertuned and underrepresented.  Ongoing content releases have mostly been focused on avatar cosmetics and other items that can't be used or show up outside of gimmick avatar battles.  Most of these come through the now-obligatory premium battlepasses; while the paid tracks ultimately can be self-sustaining if you play enough matches, they cycle extremely quickly and turn SF6 into the grindy type of live service experience.  Capcom also has gotten into using predatory micro and macrotransaction practices, using a combination of secondary mobile-style currencies (sold in bundles that never quite fit right, of course) and extremely overpriced premium cosmetics (fifteen dollar TMNT costumes, anyone?  fifteen dollars per turtle, that is).  This culminated in the long awaited Outfit 3 release, with new costumes for the whole roster - a breath of fresh air for a stagnating visual experience marred by the costumes being expensive (six dollars each), not available in any sort of bulk bundle, and only available using Capcom's secondary currency.  There is no world in which it can be considered justifiable to have to pay over 100 dollars for a roster-wide single outfit update, even if they were available a-la carte and are very high quality designs.

So, SF6.  I do recommend it if you like or want to like fighting games, because it's really a great 2D fighter. That said, if you are sensitive to or put off by some of the gaming industry's worst practices, they're showing up in full force here and there's no real indication that Capcom is listening to player feedback on the subject.  It's certainly killed a lot of my drive to follow and play the game on an ongoing fashion, and I have to note it as a real black eye on the experience."

Firstly, this game looks amazing and the World Tour is a nice little distraction.  The alt control types are very accessible, speaking from experience as my gf has carpal tunnel and she appreciates the options.

But the monetization for this game is buns.  Actively infuriating.  Full price FG with a season pass is already asking for 90 out the gate, at the very least this game released at 60.
But a BATTLE PASS with the jukebox items locked behind it that they advertised would be a FREE feature that would work similar to Tekken or even it's own in the PREVIOUS GAME in the franchise on top of the Cosume fiasco and the avatar custom stuff has me telling you to skip off of principle.  If none of that matters to you, feel free to scoop this when it's like $20 or sumn, but your best bet is to wait for the inevitable complete edition bundle 5 years from now rather than letting Capcom grift you.

I've been policed for ""quitting ranked games"" when the match had ended and was on the ""return to lobby screen"" when I disconnected from the game.

Basically you're either short of a little FC or you have too much left.

76561199470403856,1364780,True,0.509803950786590576,One word: Juri
76561197973580399,1364780,True,0.894174635410308838,"As a core product, Street Fighter 6 is a triumph.  Capcom took years of feedback about what did and didn't work through the Street Fighter 5 era, listened and adapted.  The product is polished to a mirror sheen.  As a fighting game, the systems are really well thought out, work together, and provide for a fantastic fighting experience that can be picked up easily enough but have significant depth to them.   The roster is diverse, reasonably sized, and has enough variety that you can find someone that you'll like playing.  The newcomers in particular landed incredibly well, with designs like Marisa, Manon and Kimberly being instantly iconic and full of personality.  The online experience, critical for a modern day fighting title, is also superb, with fantastic rollback netcode, plenty of features, a sensibly balanced ranked ladder, good matchmaking, and quick load times.  It's easy to load up SF6, play a bunch of online rounds, and feel like you got a great gaming experience.

Capcom also did a very savvy thing, centering the experience around two overlapping tentpoles; World Tour mode and Modern controls.  World Tour is effectively what a big budget beat-em-up would look like in the modern era - roaming around some open world maps, getting into fights, getting money and experience and cosmetics to dress up your (extremely customizable and potentially grotesquely deformed) avatar.  All the while, you're interacting with the SF6 roster, learning their styles, mixing and matching moves, and getting to know them as characters outside of the fighting arena.  It's part extended mechanics tutorial, part street brawl, and really quite a lot of fun.  It also plays extremely well with Modern controls, which is a fully usable control scheme that cuts the execution requirements from the traditional 6 button technical input scheme to a four button version that includes some simple auto-combos and one-button specials.  While purists might get snobby about it, Modern does exactly what it sets out to do - lets less experienced players be competitive in versus matches, and shift the focus from technical control inputs to the more important strategic layer of movement, positioning, traps, and mindgames, which is where fighting games shine.

All this said, SF6 is being tremendously let down and hurt by some very questionable ongoing development and business decisions.  The game itself, outside of the traditional season pass DLC characters we have so far (two of them released, two announced), has been stagnating in a way that some of its contemporaries are not; Capcom has elected to go with an annual balance patch, which means the meta hasn't really shifted since launch and characters with glaring weaknesses in their kit remain undertuned and underrepresented.  Ongoing content releases have mostly been focused on avatar cosmetics and other items that can't be used or show up outside of gimmick avatar battles.  Most of these come through the now-obligatory premium battlepasses; while the paid tracks ultimately can be self-sustaining if you play enough matches, they cycle extremely quickly and turn SF6 into the grindy type of live service experience.  Capcom also has gotten into using predatory micro and macrotransaction practices, using a combination of secondary mobile-style currencies (sold in bundles that never quite fit right, of course) and extremely overpriced premium cosmetics (fifteen dollar TMNT costumes, anyone?  fifteen dollars per turtle, that is).  This culminated in the long awaited Outfit 3 release, with new costumes for the whole roster - a breath of fresh air for a stagnating visual experience marred by the costumes being expensive (six dollars each), not available in any sort of bulk bundle, and only available using Capcom's secondary currency.  There is no world in which it can be considered justifiable to have to pay over 100 dollars for a roster-wide single outfit update, even if they were available a-la carte and are very high quality designs.

So, SF6.  I do recommend it if you like or want to like fighting games, because it's really a great 2D fighter. That said, if you are sensitive to or put off by some of the gaming industry's worst practices, they're showing up in full force here and there's no real indication that Capcom is listening to player feedback on the subject.  It's certainly killed a lot of my drive to follow and play the game on an ongoing fashion, and I have to note it as a real black eye on the experience."

But a BATTLE PASS with the jukebox items locked behind it that they advertised would be a FREE feature that would work similar to Tekken or even it's own in the PREVIOUS GAME in the franchise on top of the Cosume fiasco and the avatar custom stuff has me telling you to skip off of principle.

 the new system mechanics has its flaws, but makes up for it with a pretty unique stamina system to extend comboes. i like that misusing it to 0% also puts people in a huge disadvantage until it recovers- it is called ""burnout"" and being in burnout is BAD. although, aggressive playstyles will definitely benefit more from the mechanics until you figure out how to stop them, since blocking too much also drains it down. it's got a lot of potential basically, and while there is counterplay, i'm hoping they tone it down a bit.

 lots of content and tutorials for newcomers who aren't competitive to get their feet wet in the game too. it's even got a pretty cool single-player story mode/open world thing."

76561197973580399,1364780,True,0.894174635410308838,"As a core product, Street Fighter 6 is a triumph.  Capcom took years of feedback about what did and didn't work through the Street Fighter 5 era, listened and adapted.  The product is polished to a mirror sheen.  As a fighting game, the systems are really well thought out, work together, and provide for a fantastic fighting experience that can be picked up easily enough but have significant depth to them.   The roster is diverse, reasonably sized, and has enough variety that you can find someone that you'll like playing.  The newcomers in particular landed incredibly well, with designs like Marisa, Manon and Kimberly being instantly iconic and full of personality.  The online experience, critical for a modern day fighting title, is also superb, with fantastic rollback netcode, plenty of features, a sensibly balanced ranked ladder, good matchmaking, and quick load times.  It's easy to load up SF6, play a bunch of online rounds, and feel like you got a great gaming experience.

Capcom also did a very savvy thing, centering the experience around two overlapping tentpoles; World Tour mode and Modern controls.  World Tour is effectively what a big budget beat-em-up would look like in the modern era - roaming around some open world maps, getting into fights, getting money and experience and cosmetics to dress up your (extremely customizable and potentially grotesquely deformed) avatar.  All the while, you're interacting with the SF6 roster, learning their styles, mixing and matching moves, and getting to know them as characters outside of the fighting arena.  It's part extended mechanics tutorial, part street brawl, and really quite a lot of fun.  It also plays extremely well with Modern controls, which is a fully usable control scheme that cuts the execution requirements from the traditional 6 button technical input scheme to a four button version that includes some simple auto-combos and one-button specials.  While purists might get snobby about it, Modern does exactly what it sets out to do - lets less experienced players be competitive in versus matches, and shift the focus from technical control inputs to the more important strategic layer of movement, positioning, traps, and mindgames, which is where fighting games shine.

All this said, SF6 is being tremendously let down and hurt by some very questionable ongoing development and business decisions.  The game itself, outside of the traditional season pass DLC characters we have so far (two of them released, two announced), has been stagnating in a way that some of its contemporaries are not; Capcom has elected to go with an annual balance patch, which means the meta hasn't really shifted since launch and characters with glaring weaknesses in their kit remain undertuned and underrepresented.  Ongoing content releases have mostly been focused on avatar cosmetics and other items that can't be used or show up outside of gimmick avatar battles.  Most of these come through the now-obligatory premium battlepasses; while the paid tracks ultimately can be self-sustaining if you play enough matches, they cycle extremely quickly and turn SF6 into the grindy type of live service experience.  Capcom also has gotten into using predatory micro and macrotransaction practices, using a combination of secondary mobile-style currencies (sold in bundles that never quite fit right, of course) and extremely overpriced premium cosmetics (fifteen dollar TMNT costumes, anyone?  fifteen dollars per turtle, that is).  This culminated in the long awaited Outfit 3 release, with new costumes for the whole roster - a breath of fresh air for a stagnating visual experience marred by the costumes being expensive (six dollars each), not available in any sort of bulk bundle, and only available using Capcom's secondary currency.  There is no world in which it can be considered justifiable to have to pay over 100 dollars for a roster-wide single outfit update, even if they were available a-la carte and are very high quality designs.

So, SF6.  I do recommend it if you like or want to like fighting games, because it's really a great 2D fighter. That said, if you are sensitive to or put off by some of the gaming industry's worst practices, they're showing up in full force here and there's no real indication that Capcom is listening to player feedback on the subject.  It's certainly killed a lot of my drive to follow and play the game on an ongoing fashion, and I have to note it as a real black eye on the experience."

Firstly, this game looks amazing and the World Tour is a nice little distraction.  The alt control types are very accessible, speaking from experience as my gf has carpal tunnel and she appreciates the options.

But the monetization for this game is buns.  Actively infuriating.  Full price FG with a season pass is already asking for 90 out the gate, at the very least this game released at 60.
But a BATTLE PASS with the jukebox items locked behind it that they advertised would be a FREE feature that would work similar to Tekken or even it's own in the PREVIOUS GAME in the franchise on top of the Cosume fiasco and the avatar custom stuff has me telling you to skip off of principle.  If none of that matters to you, feel free to scoop this when it's like $20 or sumn, but your best bet is to wait for the inevitable complete edition bundle 5 years from now rather than letting Capcom grift you.

I've been policed for ""quitting ranked games"" when the match had ended and was on the ""return to lobby screen"" when I disconnected from the game.

Basically you're either short of a little FC or you have too much left.

76561199470403856,1364780,True,0.509803950786590576,One word: Juri
76561197973580399,1364780,True,0.894174635410308838,"As a core product, Street Fighter 6 is a triumph.  Capcom took years of feedback about what did and didn't work through the Street Fighter 5 era, listened and adapted.  The product is polished to a mirror sheen.  As a fighting game, the systems are really well thought out, work together, and provide for a fantastic fighting experience that can be picked up easily enough but have significant depth to them.   The roster is diverse, reasonably sized, and has enough variety that you can find someone that you'll like playing.  The newcomers in particular landed incredibly well, with designs like Marisa, Manon and Kimberly being instantly iconic and full of personality.  The online experience, critical for a modern day fighting title, is also superb, with fantastic rollback netcode, plenty of features, a sensibly balanced ranked ladder, good matchmaking, and quick load times.  It's easy to load up SF6, play a bunch of online rounds, and feel like you got a great gaming experience.

Capcom also did a very savvy thing, centering the experience around two overlapping tentpoles; World Tour mode and Modern controls.  World Tour is effectively what a big budget beat-em-up would look like in the modern era - roaming around some open world maps, getting into fights, getting money and experience and cosmetics to dress up your (extremely customizable and potentially grotesquely deformed) avatar.  All the while, you're interacting with the SF6 roster, learning their styles, mixing and matching moves, and getting to know them as characters outside of the fighting arena.  It's part extended mechanics tutorial, part street brawl, and really quite a lot of fun.  It also plays extremely well with Modern controls, which is a fully usable control scheme that cuts the execution requirements from the traditional 6 button technical input scheme to a four button version that includes some simple auto-combos and one-button specials.  While purists might get snobby about it, Modern does exactly what it sets out to do - lets less experienced players be competitive in versus matches, and shift the focus from technical control inputs to the more important strategic layer of movement, positioning, traps, and mindgames, which is where fighting games shine.

All this said, SF6 is being tremendously let down and hurt by some very questionable ongoing development and business decisions.  The game itself, outside of the traditional season pass DLC characters we have so far (two of them released, two announced), has been stagnating in a way that some of its contemporaries are not; Capcom has elected to go with an annual balance patch, which means the meta hasn't really shifted since launch and characters with glaring weaknesses in their kit remain undertuned and underrepresented.  Ongoing content releases have mostly been focused on avatar cosmetics and other items that can't be used or show up outside of gimmick avatar battles.  Most of these come through the now-obligatory premium battlepasses; while the paid tracks ultimately can be self-sustaining if you play enough matches, they cycle extremely quickly and turn SF6 into the grindy type of live service experience.  Capcom also has gotten into using predatory micro and macrotransaction practices, using a combination of secondary mobile-style currencies (sold in bundles that never quite fit right, of course) and extremely overpriced premium cosmetics (fifteen dollar TMNT costumes, anyone?  fifteen dollars per turtle, that is).  This culminated in the long awaited Outfit 3 release, with new costumes for the whole roster - a breath of fresh air for a stagnating visual experience marred by the costumes being expensive (six dollars each), not available in any sort of bulk bundle, and only available using Capcom's secondary currency.  There is no world in which it can be considered justifiable to have to pay over 100 dollars for a roster-wide single outfit update, even if they were available a-la carte and are very high quality designs.

So, SF6.  I do recommend it if you like or want to like fighting games, because it's really a great 2D fighter. That said, if you are sensitive to or put off by some of the gaming industry's worst practices, they're showing up in full force here and there's no real indication that Capcom is listening to player feedback on the subject.  It's certainly killed a lot of my drive to follow and play the game on an ongoing fashion, and I have to note it as a real black eye on the experience."

But the monetization for this game is buns.  Actively infuriating.  Full price FG with a season pass is already asking for 90 out the gate, at the very least this game released at 60.
But a BATTLE PASS with the jukebox items locked behind it that they advertised would be a FREE feature that would work similar to Tekken or even it's own in the PREVIOUS GAME in the franchise on top of the Cosume fiasco and the avatar custom stuff has me telling you to skip off of principle.

76561199470403856,1364780,True,0.509803950786590576,One word: Juri
76561197973580399,1364780,True,0.894174635410308838,"As a core product, Street Fighter 6 is a triumph.  Capcom took years of feedback about what did and didn't work through the Street Fighter 5 era, listened and adapted.  The product is polished to a mirror sheen.  As a fighting game, the systems are really well thought out, work together, and provide for a fantastic fighting experience that can be picked up easily enough but have significant depth to them.   The roster is diverse, reasonably sized, and has enough variety that you can find someone that you'll like playing.  The newcomers in particular landed incredibly well, with designs like Marisa, Manon and Kimberly being instantly iconic and full of personality.  The online experience, critical for a modern day fighting title, is also superb, with fantastic rollback netcode, plenty of features, a sensibly balanced ranked ladder, good matchmaking, and quick load times.  It's easy to load up SF6, play a bunch of online rounds, and feel like you got a great gaming experience.

Capcom also did a very savvy thing, centering the experience around two overlapping tentpoles; World Tour mode and Modern controls.  World Tour is effectively what a big budget beat-em-up would look like in the modern era - roaming around some open world maps, getting into fights, getting money and experience and cosmetics to dress up your (extremely customizable and potentially grotesquely deformed) avatar.  All the while, you're interacting with the SF6 roster, learning their styles, mixing and matching moves, and getting to know them as characters outside of the fighting arena.  It's part extended mechanics tutorial, part street brawl, and really quite a lot of fun.  It also plays extremely well with Modern controls, which is a fully usable control scheme that cuts the execution requirements from the traditional 6 button technical input scheme to a four button version that includes some simple auto-combos and one-button specials.  While purists might get snobby about it, Modern does exactly what it sets out to do - lets less experienced players be competitive in versus matches, and shift the focus from technical control inputs to the more important strategic layer of movement, positioning, traps, and mindgames, which is where fighting games shine.

All this said, SF6 is being tremendously let down and hurt by some very questionable ongoing development and business decisions.  The game itself, outside of the traditional season pass DLC characters we have so far (two of them released, two announced), has been stagnating in a way that some of its contemporaries are not; Capcom has elected to go with an annual balance patch, which means the meta hasn't really shifted since launch and characters with glaring weaknesses in their kit remain undertuned and underrepresented.  Ongoing content releases have mostly been focused on avatar cosmetics and other items that can't be used or show up outside of gimmick avatar battles.  Most of these come through the now-obligatory premium battlepasses; while the paid tracks ultimately can be self-sustaining if you play enough matches, they cycle extremely quickly and turn SF6 into the grindy type of live service experience.  Capcom also has gotten into using predatory micro and macrotransaction practices, using a combination of secondary mobile-style currencies (sold in bundles that never quite fit right, of course) and extremely overpriced premium cosmetics (fifteen dollar TMNT costumes, anyone?  fifteen dollars per turtle, that is).  This culminated in the long awaited Outfit 3 release, with new costumes for the whole roster - a breath of fresh air for a stagnating visual experience marred by the costumes being expensive (six dollars each), not available in any sort of bulk bundle, and only available using Capcom's secondary currency.  There is no world in which it can be considered justifiable to have to pay over 100 dollars for a roster-wide single outfit update, even if they were available a-la carte and are very high quality designs.

So, SF6.  I do recommend it if you like or want to like fighting games, because it's really a great 2D fighter. That said, if you are sensitive to or put off by some of the gaming industry's worst practices, they're showing up in full force here and there's no real indication that Capcom is listening to player feedback on the subject.  It's certainly killed a lot of my drive to follow and play the game on an ongoing fashion, and I have to note it as a real black eye on the experience."

Firstly, this game looks amazing and the World Tour is a nice little distraction.  The alt control types are very accessible, speaking from experience as my gf has carpal tunnel and she appreciates the options.

But the monetization for this game is buns.  Actively infuriating.  Full price FG with a season pass is already asking for 90 out the gate, at the very least this game released at 60.
But a BATTLE PASS with the jukebox items locked behind it that they advertised would be a FREE feature that would work similar to Tekken or even it's own in the PREVIOUS GAME in the franchise on top of the Cosume fiasco and the avatar custom stuff has me telling you to skip off of principle.  If none of that matters to you, feel free to scoop this when it's like $20 or sumn, but your best bet is to wait for the inevitable complete edition bundle 5 years from now rather than letting Capcom grift you.

1: Microtransactions that are very anti consumer. You can't buy any DLC directly from the steam store, you need to buy fighter coins (premium currency) but the issue is all DLC costume/character is 300-350 FC. The cheapest FC only has a quantity 250 FC. So you either buy the cheapest twice or go with the next tier which have a quantity of 610 FC. Basically you're either short of a little FC or you have too much left.

2: Cheaters/Script users especially in platinum 5 to high master rank. You know its real when pro players such as Fchamp is literally hunting these mfers and posting the videos on his youtube channel.

Let me elaborate on the ""Friend Pass"" like I mentioned!

Party Animal's ""Friend Pass"" is different then Steam's ""Remote Play"", ""Remote Play"" requires you to have all your friends use your extra PC resources by having them play on your machine remotely with added latency, but with Party Animal's built in ""Friend Pass"" all your friends can have the game for free basically, they just can't play anything but the tutorial unless you as the ownership friend invite them to a lobby, then they can play, all without hogging your essential PC resources so you can still get good frames with them without added network and hardware latency as well!

Campaign is short, it's not that long not that short. Nonetheless it's still a fun and an enjoyable experience. While I do think that the story is basically a tutorial to prepare the players for the multiplayer, but playing only the story content is also good if you are really interested in the single player content only.

Multiplayer is hard, people playing here are basically players that already played this game for a really long time. So is it fun as a new player to compete with high level players?
In my opinion, yes it is still fun thanks to this particular game mode, [b] ""Attrition"" [/b].
Basically it is a 6v6 game mode with AI / bots playing as an infantry that you frequently meet in the campaign. Goal is, one of the two teams has to reach the highest points, that includes killing the bots. So, if you're new, you can basically just kill a bunch of bots to make your team winning and get more points. Even if you're terrible and not to good, you can still contribute it for the team.

Unfortunately, playing Battlefield V has become impossible due to the many cheaters. The question is not if but how many cheaters there will be in the server. The BFVHackers site makes making a choice somewhat easier, but after playing for a while you will still encounter cheaters. And no matter how much I want and try to play it, it only leads to annoyance. I have played many hours over the past few days. Well, played, spectating cheaters. That can't be the point of the game.

However, it is crazy that the Battlefield V community has to identify cheaters. That's really EA/DICE's job. And if you keep coming across the same cheaters who are clearly cheating, then I really wonder what is actually being done against all those clowns who cheat.

Yes, keep reporting, we are doing everything we can to ban cheaters. NOT.
And then we have that great EA app. For a few days now, the app has been crashing regularly when I try to report cheaters. Awesome!

Remnant 2 is an absolute blast to play, and there's a lot of content and fun to be had here through multiple playthroughs. I don't feel even close to done at 60 hours!

You would be doing this game a disservice to not at least experience each of the worlds' 2 possible campaigns at least once.

World design is incredible, voice acting is generally fantastic (aside from the occasional funny line), and the gameplay offers a very diverse range of builds and playstyles. There are around 10 archetypes that you can equip 2 of at a time - i would perhaps recommend looking these up eventually because the chance of stumbling upon most of them accidentally without knowledge is very unlikely. This game is full of secrets and you'll find things in different playthroughs that you likely missed the first time in an area! 

The biggest complaints about the first game were the aesthetic/colour palette diversity between worlds, and the boss design. Thankfully both of these things are massively improved in the sequel. All bosses are mechanically different and don't rely on spawning ""adds"" to increase difficulty every single boss fight. The worlds are all also very diverse and have vastly different design styles, and they're a joy to experience.

My only complaints about this game are questionable performance at times, and the inventory UI is pretty atrocious. Having to hover over hundreds of rings/amulets/mutators to see what they are is simply hard to use. I wish they at least had item name labels at a glance.

Overall incredible game and i'm yet to even see it all. Can't wait for the future DLC for this gem. This has quickly become one of my favourite games i've ever played and i highly recommend people trying it even if Remnant: From The Ashes didn't ""click"" with them."
76561198020833463,1282100,True,0.523809552192687988,"It's a fun squeal. Bigger game than the original, which plays and feels like its from the same series, which is great because these games are worthy of a series. The use of randomisation continues to be refreshing, and I think they do it better than anyone. We see a lot of recurring characters. I'd say while it was fun, it did not seem as interesting as the first game in terms of story, I think mostly because it was more of a retelling or continuation than a new story, nothing stood out as grabbing my attention, which was disappointing because Remnant did that very well. That being said, the diversity in the classes, equipment, and the worlds themselves are considerably better. All the replay value is there, and larger than the original. They took away survival mode, which was my favourite mode, so I do not like that. 

Good game, big, not disappointing. Story is lacking compared to the original, game play is better. Wish they bring survival mode back. Looking forward to the content updates."
76561198260491602,242760,True,0.545454561710357666,"The Forest stands as a shining example of survival horror gaming, delivering an immersive and chilling experience that plunges players into the heart of a mysterious and unforgiving wilderness. As an avid enthusiast of the genre, I found myself drawn into the game's haunting atmosphere, gripping narrative, and relentless tension, making it a standout title in the realm of survival horror.

At its core, The Forest thrusts players into the role of a lone survivor of a plane crash who finds themselves stranded on a remote island shrouded in mystery and danger. As you navigate the dense forests and treacherous terrain, you must scavenge for resources, build shelter, and fend off hostile mutants who lurk in the shadows.

What sets The Forest apart from other survival horror games is its emphasis on exploration and discovery. As you venture deeper into the island's dark and foreboding depths, you'll uncover clues and unravel the sinister secrets that lie hidden beneath the surface. From abandoned campsites and ominous caves to enigmatic artifacts and haunting visions, every discovery brings you one step closer to uncovering the truth behind the island's dark past.

But perhaps what truly elevates The Forest is its dynamic and emergent gameplay. The game's open-world environment is teeming with wildlife, flora, and fauna, each reacting realistically to your actions and the ever-changing environment. Whether you're hunting for food, crafting weapons and tools, or building elaborate fortifications to defend against the mutant hordes, every decision you make carries weighty consequences that shape your survival.

Moreover, The Forest offers a compelling multiplayer experience that allows players to team up with friends and explore the island together. Whether you're cooperating to build a fortified base or competing to survive against the island's hostile inhabitants, the multiplayer mode adds an extra layer of tension and excitement to an already gripping experience.

In conclusion, The Forest is a haunting and gripping tale of survival that delivers an unforgettable journey into the heart of darkness. With its immersive atmosphere, compelling narrative, and dynamic gameplay, it stands as a must-play for fans of the survival horror genre. So, if you're ready to brave the dangers of the wilderness and uncover the secrets of the island, prepare yourself for an unforgettable experience in The Forest."

The game takes place in a very distant future where planet Earth now lives under the rule of a species of ""robotic Jurassic creatures"". In the game, you take control of Aloy, a young girl who, as a child, was abandoned by her parents and ended up being raised by exiles from the Nora tribe.

Throughout the game, we embark on a journey that tells the character's story, from the mysteries surrounding her birth, to her evolution as a warrior. In the midst of this, there are a series of twists and turns that make the script incredibly engaging.
There is also the possibility of shaping Aloy's personality according to the direction of the dialogues. In other words, her answers make the character a friendlier figure or even firmer in her attitudes. Too bad it doesn't lead to a good amount of different endings.

[b]Horizon Zero Dawn[/b] stands out for being one of the games with the most charming graphics of this current generation. The work done by the producer [b]Guerrilla Games[/b] manages to immerse the player in a way never seen before, both in its various animations and in the gameplay.
The scenarios impress with their wealth of detail. Both the vegetation and the relief of the game have characteristics of each region of the map. In other words, in colder environments there is a certain type of species, while in warmer parts everything is very different.

[b]With the characters, the excellent work was maintained. Both in the animations, which can express the feeling of the scenes, and in the game playing, with details such as tattoos, scars, clothing, etc. The creatures also take special care. It is easy to differentiate each one of them by their characteristics, size and movement.[/b]

The game's dubbing could be better. In the main characters, special care was taken with intonation and even the fitting of the dialogues. As for the supporting actors, it is possible to notice a lack of care, whether in expressing the feelings that the scene demands, or when fitting a line into the movement of the animation.

[b]Horizon Zero Dawn[/b]'s combat system leaves something to be desired. When weapons such as bows and arrows or machine guns are used, the aiming system works very well. Additionally, some skills help, such as those that create a kind of slow motion so that Aloy can shoot more accurately.
The direct combat system, using your spear, is flawed. This is because the game's camera greatly interferes with actions, whether it's when dodging opponents' attacks or finding them and countering them.
The feeling is that this system is missing elements, such as an option to lock the aim on a specific target or enemy. This would make it a lot easier, especially when performing acrobatics to escape your opponents' attacks without losing sight of them.

Another point that deserves to be highlighted in the game is the skill evolution system. They are essential for success in the game, as many of these skills are vital for confrontations, such as expanding item storage.
To acquire new skills you need to accumulate experience points, which are acquired through actions in the game. By eliminating creatures or completing objectives, you accumulate XP to pass levels and unlock new skills. This increases the lifespan of the game, encouraging the player to evolve before proceeding with the main objectives.

[b]There are also ways to improve your equipment throughout the game or even create it. To do this, you need to accumulate items, from specific plants to scraps from defeated robotic creatures.[/b]

[b]Horizon Zero Dawn[/b] is a must-play game! With an incredibly detailed visual and a plot full of twists and turns that keeps us engaged in long dialogues, the gameplay problems do not compromise the final result of this masterpiece, one of Sony's best games.

In Steam, I was surprised at the price and bought it at the old price tag, I had a feeling that the price would be raised :)

The port is a nightmare, the game is terribly not optimized, it is banally difficult to run. Horizon Zero Dawn itself did not surprise me as a game, but it left a pleasant impression.

The gameplay in the game, as for me, is inferior to the same Witcher 3, there are not so many RPG elements, there is even a bit of monotonous grind, in terms of gameplay it is still interesting, the action game with robots is impressive. The game has excellent graphics, very beautiful landscapes. The prologue is too long and boring for me, the plot is not striking, but it is interesting to watch it. Ent is very banal, as for me the setting is very unusual and original - it is repulsive. There is terrible optimization on the PC, the game is trite to start, you will have to update the drivers, move the sliders in the settings. The graphic game has not changed in any way since the PS4, it has become even worse and more soapy on the PC. Horizon Zero Dawn I still liked, the open world is a bit empty - but it is interesting to find it, some quests, cutscenes are done perfectly.

The story is engrossing.  The world lives and breathes around you.  Combat is fun and rewards you for trying different things when killing machines.  The characters have depth to them and even the side quests are fun.  All in all this game ticks all the boxes for me when it comes to open world rpgs.  

So, if you like a story that unfolds into various layers because you not only want to know more about the main character's quest to find answers but the world they live in too?  This game might be for you.

If you like combat that can be tricky and interesting because there are many different types of enemies, this game might be for you.

If you like losing hours just hunting (animals and machines) and gathering to craft your ammo and potions, this might be for you.

If you like boring stories and uninteresting combat this game isn't for you."

Didn't want to pay full price so put it in the wish list until it was on sale.  Have to say I got my full moneys worth playing the game, the story was fairly interesting, the enemies were quite tough sometimes, the gameplay is very smooth and the graphics too.  It's difficult to compare it to other games, but if you like RPG games it's a must play.

I then realized why I left the game a long time ago, and I'm typing this down as a reminder should I come back to it for some reason other than to play with friends.

Some characters are insufferable (*cough cough* Barney), and it's frustrating with how the story goes (while I get the story isn't the main focus of the game, in my opinion, it hinders enough to make me want to skip a lot of the dialogue options).

In terms of gameplay, it can be enjoyable with a mix of frustrating (it doesn't feel right when a player death feels like ""oh the game f*cked me over"", versus ""oh, I wasn't skilled enough, it was my fault"", where a number of deaths experienced were due to some janky game mechanics). Also, repairing the weapons in this game are much more expensive as compared to the first game, and while it's cheaper to find more weapons than to repair the current one, I sometimes like keeping my current weapon/s, and grinding for resources to repair them feels more grindy than worthwhile.

I honestly think the devs just could not figure out what made DL1 so magical. The movement mechanics are solid but the map, lore, and a ton of other mechanics and elements leave a lot to be desired. If you are new to the DL series, you should 180% start out with DL1 because this is just some weird ubisoft open world knock off that just doesnt feel right at any turn. Like if you wanted to make a game equal parts ubisoft title (assasins creed/far cry) and DL1 this would be it and it just doesnt land. Even in the way you think it should and that is a shame because almost everything here is ""good"" but it is just not dying light and i always find myself going back to the original when I want that experience. That honestly makes me sad because I had really high hopes but this game when from low tier to just mid and its very obvious that it is not about to pull a no mans sky because the whole foundation of the game is just weak compared to DL1. If youre new, do not start here, but if you have totally finished the first just kinda consider this to be a weak fan made game of the original."

The shaders for this game takes 20 minutes to load even after patch after patch of fixes for this exact problem. This game already had its cyberpunk moment.

Less than 3 minutes of progress lost, and I was not even upset due to the hilarity of the bug and how gorgeous the game looks to replay. A minor annoyance and did not ruin my playthrough.

I took a long break, but the game still bores me with its gameplay. Too much grind. Too much time is spent traveling between locations. Every Assassin's Creed game since Origins has been full of time-wasting mechanics. Plus the game is full of bugs. There is also a critical problem - random crashes. 

As for the universe of the series. AC has never been a historically accurate series, but since Origins (or even Syndicate), the game has completely devolved into mythological action. Valhalla made things even worse with this ""strong women"" bullshit. It was all terrible to watch. Cringe level was very high. At least in Odyssey you could ignore this crap by playing as Alexios, even though they made him non-canon. There are a lot of masculine women in Valhalla. 

I won't be giving lectures on history here, but here are some details. Many historians claim that Viking women are a myth. They did not participate in the raids, but the word ""Vikingr"" was used to describe pirates and raiders from Scandinavia. Arguments against this theory are tales about Valkyries (mythological creatures), one Saga about a warrior woman and one grave of some important person who was clearly not buried according to tradition. There are many other versions about what women did during Viking times. This doesn't fit with the Viking women theory at all. This series has never been famous for its gameplay. The plot, characters and a certain amount of historicity made it interesting. So, how am I supposed to take the Valhalla plot seriously? 

In Valhalla, I noticed more dialogue options for gay sex. 

We can talk at length about the problems of Valhalla and the AC in general, but I won‚Äôt do that. I don't recommend this game.

As a comparison. I just had finished AC Odyssey and as deciding between this and Origins.  Valhalla is good, its fine.  But it is missing something critical that the other two definitely had, a strong motive for the player.  It feels as though Eivor and Sifried just left to find adventure and settle the new world, and that's it.  Both Odyssey and Origins started off with exciting plots that left me with a quest for vengeance.  In Valhalla, vengeance was found early on, and well, then I just left home to go do stuff.  

The open world mechanics are fine, and there a million different resources to collect, and tons to craft, and mini-games that are there own element.  There is A LOT OF CONTENT, but more isn't always better."

That's why i have to say this. This game continues to deteriorate with each passing year. I was already fed up when they changed the controls for no reason on 2K23. But these new problems are just next f***ing level.

1st gripe: Submissions are broken AF. I have to go into the gameplay settings (for the first time in my life) just to adjust the penalty for button pressing during a submission. I have been submitted in like 2-3 seconds EVERY TIME because the submission system does not register ANYTHING you press. Going up against a overall 69-75 character? Get submitted even if you have maxed out submission defenses.

2nd gripe: Tag Team matches are butchered once again. I haven't been able to enjoy tag team wrestling since 2k19. It wasn't enough that in the last two-three games, you had to rush and get a perfect moment to pin or submit your opponent.  If the NPC's tag team partner was not stunned, you were not getting a victory. NOW......oh boy let me tell you. If you switch legal tag team partner assignments so you can run in and break up pins, you can't do that anymore. I watched my Seth Rollins get pinned while i was outside the ring trying to run inside and break up the pin......couldn't get into the ring. 

3rd gripe: Pin animation is garbage. Why couldn't they keep the animation from 2k23? It was slowed down and seemed real. Now every time you go to pin, your character is rushing/speeding to make a cover every time.  

4th gripe: Whatever you do, do NOT allow the enemy NPC to have a manager. You will break your controller. If you get taunted, you are stuck looking at that manager for like 20-30 seconds."

Firstly, the pacing of this game shoots you right into this thick of the fight, with many upgrades and enemies coming into your vision. 

Having experienced games such as Vampire Survivors, Halls of Torment, Death Must Die, even to an extent Hades, I'm familiar to the extent of games like these are portrayed and made to pass time very fast, and to give you that amazing feeling of ""Just 1 more run"". 

The graphics of this game are far different than other 2D variants in the genre, which blends well for how DRG has always been. As this game is still in Early Access, I would expect them to continually take on feedback similar to how they did with the original game, as this was an aspect which really carried them to the ""Overwhelmingly positive"" review page you see today on steam.

Whilst some runs are quite short so far, it does make the game easy to pickup and play at your own leisure. There is a good variety of weapons and classes, similar to the 2020 version. As time goes on, we should expect more maps, weapons, and fun builds to tinker with. 

Overall in its current state I would recommend DRG Survivor. It runs well, offers a short but sweet packed punch and I'm sure with the developers at hand they have, will continuously grow further into an even better experience."

Like the first game in the Series Mudrunner, Snowrunner follows the same basic gameplay, Transport things however you see fit from A to B, or C, sometimes D, and ‚Äúgod damn why is this street flooded and I am stuck in the mud to my headlights??‚Äù
   
[u][b]Gameplay[/b][/u]  
Saying the gameplay is simple is an understatement and not what Snowrunner aims for. While on the base, the gameplay is transport goods from A to B however you want, there is much much more to it. 
You Start out with a single truck, and earn money through your first easier jobs, but very soon you will get in contact with one of the main aspects and one of the big selling points of the game. The Physics Engine. 
I think it is fair to say, that still, Snowrunner has one of the best Physics simulations on the marked. 
The game simulates the inertia of the each of the many vehicles you can obtain individually, and how they affect the mud, dirt, snow and ice you displace (or get stuck in) when you drive through it and saves the state of it. Which is impressive on its own in my opinion. 
And this is where the great appeal of the game lies. Each transport is a challenge on its own. Which route to take, do you have enough fuel? Can your current vehicle conquer the terrain with the added weight of the goods you want to transport, or can you take this route with a long trailer behind you? Maybe go for the longer route or risk the shortcut and potentially become stuck? 

But don‚Äôt worry, if you get stuck, you can either try to rescue your vehicle with another one from your fleet, or let it be transported to the nearest Garage. 
  
Snowrunner also features a detailed damage system and much more.
There are countless upgrades all over the world to find for your vehicles to modify/tune them in your garages! 
 
The different objectives also offer a good variety of challenges and hey, maybe you can find a new vehicle stuck in some swamp at the corner of a map? And must figure out how you can rescue it? It‚Äôs for you to discover. 


[u][b]Features/TL;DR[/b][/u]  
-Great Physic Simulation
-Huge Map
-Lots of Vehicles, upgrades
-Many different goals and challenges
-Detailed damage simulation 
 
 
[u][b]Final Thoughts[/b][/u]  
I play these kinds of game very rarely, but Snowrunner really captured me. Playing around with the different vehicles and upgrades and dragging yourself through deep mud and snow combined with the amazing physics simulation is just way too much fun. 
If you are into Simulation/Transport games, Snowrunner is a must play.  
And if you rarely or never play these games, but think ‚Äúhey this could be fun‚Äù its absolutely worth to give this game a shot.

The attention to detail in capturing the essence of Greek mythology is both awe-inspiring and nostalgic, evoking a sense of pride in my cultural heritage. From the iconic gods and goddesses to the mythical beasts and legendary locations, every aspect of the game feels like a loving homage to the stories I grew up hearing. The authenticity and reverence with which Supergiant Games has portrayed these mythological figures add an extra layer of immersion for me as a Greek player.
However, what truly sets Hades apart is its narrative richness. The story unfolds organically, revealing layers of intrigue, emotion, and character development with each escape attempt. The interactions between Zagreus and the denizens of the underworld are memorable, breathing life into characters straight from the pages of mythology.
Each escape attempt feels fresh thanks to procedurally generated levels and a wide array of weapons and abilities(boons, aspects etc) to experiment with. This unique blend of genres makes Hades one of the most innovative and captivating games I've had the pleasure of playing even though (i'm going to be honest) the first time i played the game, i didn't particularly like it. It really grows on you and if you feel like you can't get past a boss, give yourself some time. You will get better, trust me.
Overall, Hades is a triumph of game design. Its attention to detail, polished gameplay, captivating story, and innovative rogue-like mechanics make it a must-play for fans of action RPGs and Greek mythology alike. Whether you're battling through the depths of Tartarus or forging bonds with gods and monsters, Hades offers an unforgettable journey that will keep you coming back for more.
Its definitely a 10/10. I eagerly anticipate the release of Hades 2!"

In almost every competition, people fight each other, no one cares about anything, fair play is a completely unknown in this game, at least at the beginner level. Maybe it's different above the D-class  but I gave up after I couldn't get higher than D, due to so many idiots. In addition, it is an extremely expensive product, monthly subscription fee, minimal content, and you have to pay 12-16 dollars for each track and car. So by the time you get to the point of putting together the most popular track and car package, you've burned through hundreds of dollars. But the worst thing is the behavior of people. The RaceRoom is much more enjoyable, there are far fewer accidents and intentional crashes. In addition, iRacing is also outdated in terms of its graphics. I'm sure this game generates huge revenue, but not a cent has been spent on improving the graphics or the user interface. Maybe the simulation is uniquely great (although I'm not sure about that either, RaceRoom and ACC bring this level), but iRacing, which is outdated in many ways, is simply not worth the huge investment. Both in terms of time and money."

76561198081853470,440,True,0.545454561710357666,"I'm writing this review after having decided to get back into this game after years of not playing it.

Team Fortress 2 was the first game that I played when I created my Steam account back in January 2013. Naturally, it has a special place in my heart as it is not only one of my favorite games of all time but also what got me into other Valve games and helped learn exactly what Steam was in the first place. I always tell myself that I only wish I knew about Steam years earlier so I could've experienced it for much longer. I say that again now but for much more painful reasons. The state of this beloved game has significantly degraded and gotten worse because of Valve's abandonment. But I will get to that later. What are the actual problems?

It's hard to pick a place to start so here it goes: no major updates since Jungle Inferno 2017, cheaters run rampant and make the game unplayable, bot scripts with aimbot run rampant and make the game unplayable, matchmaking takes forever because there are no servers, very awful conduct by community members bordering on straight-up ILLEGAL activity, promises made but not kept, bugs found but not fixed. the list goes on and on. For a game that is supposed to be ""free to play"" Valve sure has gone a long way in allowing it to be a pay to play game by just allowing this stuff to continue. Yes, they ARE allowing it.

At a certain point you cannot just assume ignorance when such a project has gone to this state. While I cannot say for sure that Valve is trying to kill the game (after all they decide what projects they work on) they are making it ABUNDANTLY clear that it is no longer a concern to them. I understand taking on other projects but to abandon something as big as Team Fortress 2 and it's community is a very serious middle finger. The one thing a lot of people, not just Valve, fail to understand is that Team Fortress 2 is no longer just a project where they can simply pull the plug whenever they wish. They may have been the creators but the game has taken a life of it's own. 

It is true that all things must come to an end at some point but not all of these will be left down to the will of one person or one company. There is only one group of people who will decide when it is over and that's TF2's community itself. As long as they exist, the game WILL exist. It is a unique class-based shooter that has surpassed it's age and stood the test of time. It is not a project that Valve can simply choose to ignore until people stop asking. It is the exact opposite. People will keep asking until Valve responds. The game is simply too big to abandon and if Valve doesn't acknowledge this fact they will only hurt their reputation further. 

People are tired of videogame companies ignoring them and making their own choices. A business is a business but at the same time they do owe it to people to keep certain projects up to date or to pass the torch to someone else. It absolutely hurts me that the very first game that got me into Steam is now a dire example of companies prioritizing profit over making art. With videogames now also getting more pricey it is this trend that will inevitably lead to people buying less and less videogames as time goes on. Companies like Valve need to look in the mirror and remember who they are, what got them where they are, and understand that to an extend they work for us too. You may be able to choose what projects to work on but when you choose NOT to work on a game like TF2 that is also a choice. 

I cannot recommend this game if you intend on spending any real money. It is free to play so that at least makes it worth trying if it at all interests you. But don't open crates, don't buy items in the market, don't give them any money. They haven't earned it. 

Team Fortress 2 will always be a solid game forever but now it sadly also serves as a prime example of how this industry is changing and not for the better."

Dear Overcooked 2,

Please accept this letter as formal notification that I am resigning from my position as a sous chef with Overcooked 2. My last day will be Today.

Thank you so much for the opportunity to work in this position for the past 6 hours. I‚Äôve greatly enjoyed and appreciated the opportunities I‚Äôve had to suffer thropugh campaign levels 5-5 and 6-2 respectively. I‚Äôve learned that i would rather stick my head in the deep fryer than play these 2 levels again, which I will take this experience with me throughout my career.

During my last two seconds, I‚Äôll do everything possible to wrap up my duties and train other team members. Please let me know if there‚Äôs anything else I can do to help during the transition.

I wish the company continued success, and I hope to stay in touch in the future.

Sincerely,
Me

Prepare yourselves for the culinary chaos that awaits in Overcooked 2! We're talking about a game that will turn your kitchen into a battleground of hilarity and chaos faster than you can say ""extra cheese""!
Are you ready to embark on a culinary adventure that will test your teamwork, coordination, and sanity?

But beware, as you chop, fry, and serve your way through each level, you'll encounter obstacles more ridiculous than a kitchen stocked with rubber chickens and slippery floors.
So, gather your fellow culinary daredevils, put on your chef hats, and get ready to dish out some laughter and chaos in Overcooked 2. Just remember, in the world of Overcooked, the only thing hotter than the ovens is the competition!

Back 4 Blood in 2024 is a competent co-op horde shooter that's worth your time. It's plain ol' zombie killing goodness. The twist revolves around deck building to create useful, unique, and sometimes broken classes. Be a melee tank that leeches health from kills or a demolition class that runs around the map with a pocket full of explosives. Play the team medic that keeps everyone buffed and alive or play a high damage sniper that drops threats from long distances. Shotgun builds clear rooms and stumble big threats, LMGs and ARs can mow through Ridden if you've got ammo bags and reload cards, and sidearm builds let you weave through hordes while taking them out with precision headshots. Even the character you choose can play a role in buffing your build. 

There's a couple hundred cards to choose from so get creative in the ways you min/max your decks, but be aware that there are certain cards that are pretty necessary for the challenge of higher difficulties. Don't expect to jump into Veteran or worse and just start slaying. Clear the campaign on Recruit (yes, the easiest difficulty) a time or three. That will reward you with a chunk of ""supply points"" that are spent on ""supply lines"" to unlock cards. Joining random in-progress runs through Quickplay gives a supply point multiplier, but playing offline with bots still works if you prefer that. 

Playing the campaign on recruit will also help you learn important game mechanics. A lot of levels have unique puzzles and strategies that are best learned when you're not fighting to stay alive. Learn how health works, how trauma damage affects it, and how to heal it at first aid stations or manage it with temporary health like pills. A good newbie character is Karlee, as she has a passive that outlines mutations (special infected) for you. Learn the signs and sounds of mutations so you can deal with them before they overwhelm your team with heavy damage and hazards or incapacitate teammates with grapples.

Teamwork! Pinging dangerous mutations to alert your team or pointing them to equipment, first-aid, and item stashes can really help influence the success of a run. Difficulties above Recruit introduce friendly fire so be aware and try not to kill your teammates. Avoid going solo as you'll be picked off if you're caught unaware with nobody to help you.

Be on the lookout for the currency you pick up and use during runs called Copper. Copper is split evenly among all players and you all manage your own balance. It's locked into your in-progress runs and wipes when you beat or fail the chapter. Copper can be spent at a supply chest at the beginning of every level before you leave the safe room. Copper cards and careful saving can allow you to buy permanent team buffs for the rest of your run that increase the quality of items and gadgets or increase the amount you can carry. Second to those are small team stat buffs for health, ammo, and stamina, but I wouldn't prioritize them if copper is tight. Guns, melee weapons, mods, ammo, and items are available but resist buying too many of these as you can easily find all of that during a level.

Every level has randomly selected Corruption cards that influence enemy types, environmental hazards, special bosses or events, and extra challenges that you can perform for bonus Copper. If you have the DLC (or play with anyone who does) then you might find Ridden Lair entrances during a level. Be aware that these skip the rest of your current level and are meant as a challenge. They're unique underground hives that have extreme Corruption cards active and are your only way of acquiring the Skull Totems used to unlock rare and powerful DLC cards. Take the risk if you feel up to it but I'd recommend learning the main levels first.

Play with friends for maximum fun but I don't find playing with randoms too bad, even with Crossplay enabled. There's plenty of good players that hang out in Quickplay and people that make public online runs you can join. The PvP mode (Swarm) was basically DoA and is a ghost town at this point so don't bother. The campaign is plenty long and varied with a lot of replayability due to Corruption cards and deck building mixing with classic horde shooter mechanics. 

I recommend Back 4 Blood now in 2024 wholeheartedly. I've played it on my old Xbox and now my PC. I've probably got a couple hundred hours combined between the two and it's definitely an enjoyable and worthwhile experience. Throw out your expectations, grab it on a crazy sale, and give it a fair shot."
76561198408688603,924970,True,0.523809552192687988,"I absolutley recommend Back4Blood In 2024. Its not Left4Dead by any means but the coop Is really fun. If you have a team that dosent constantly alert hordes and can play smart Its quite good. The card decks are confusing and really weird at first but once you get the hang of It you can make some good builds. I recomend starting at recruit difficulty becaus you can learn the mechanics and get the hang of It. Which means you can really experiment with all the different playable characters and cards. All the characters are quirky and Intresting In their own way with just enough backstory that they are not cardboard cutouts (kinda like the original left4dead). The level desing Is also quite good, Its not full blown linear. You can sometimes go slighlty of the main path and explore rooms for loot. This game Is the best In the regard of replayabilty. Every playthrou feels quite different In some shape or form. Which leads me to corruption cards which can alter the enviroment or AI In a way. Also It can determin the fact how much copper you can take, how strong are the enemies and what types of enemies spawn. Copper Is like the In game currency. You always have enough and I was never In the shortage of It. The guns can be customized slighlty In game like different gun barrles, sights or stocks which give buffs or nerfs to certain weapons. Also there are lots of skins for weapons and main characters which can be earned In game while claiming ""supply lines"".

76561197968039438,686810,True,0.545454561710357666,"You want the truth? WELL MAYBE YOU CANNOT HANDLE THE TRUTH! This is WAR! Strap on your stompers, shoulder that rifle and GET ON THE TRUCK PRIVATE!

What's that private? Your SCOPE? WHAT ARE YOU, SOME SORT OF SHORT SIGHTED PANSY? If you can't see nothing, you DOUBLETIME YOUR ASS CLOSER TO THE FRONT AND MAKE SURE YOU LAND THOSE SHOTS!

Tired of hoofing it back and forth because you couldn't keep your noggin' down far enough? WELL TOUGH LUCK SOLDIER. You want a garrison closer to the battle YOU GET YOURSELF SOME SUPPLIES AND BLOODY BUILD IT YOURSELF!

If you step into hell, don't be expecting any fancy porselain toilets, king sized mattresses or burgers for dinner. You will lie in a muddy ditch for a day hoping to shoot the enemies' lights out and you will be damn grateful if your commander graces you with a bombing run so the way is clear to return to base for a shoveled toilet, cold rations and a stiff blanket for the other muddy ditch you call home. 

Don't expect to be magically transported into airborne planes with tactical huds that resupply mid-air and forget about chilling on a hilltop somewhere with your two dozen sniper buddies, too. Best you can hope for is to cling on for dear life on the back of an antique truck and hope to make it to the front without losing your head and yes, I mean that quite literally. In this game, death comes quicker than a teenager that has just discovered the internet.

This game strips away almost every creature comfort modern shooters have pampered you with over the past 20 years but what you get in return is a sense of real achievement once you finally breast that hill without kicking the bucket and landing your first iron-sighted shot onto an unlucky enemy solder who didn't hear you thundering in on your 4 pound mudkickers all while trying not to get torn apart from friendly fire or a rogue artillery shell. The playerbase is built of real people who understand what you're going through and are not above lending a helping hand, often quite literally (no, not THAT way, realism only goes so far), helping you navigate and survive the battlefield. 

Are there issues? Loads. The framerate tanks harder than the actual armored vehicles they supply you with and for all the focus on realism there is still a lot of ground to be gained in terms of game mechanics. You can't look up when crawling (probably some sort of collective spinal injury from hitting the ground running, because this game does NOT hold your hand and for unclear reasons only the yankees could afford to build you a practice range) and while a single bullet is often enough to end every soldier, the mud and stone buildings or even haystacks and bushes have no issue withstanding mortar fire or armor piercing shells. The game features Dr. Iznogood's miracle 'Cure-all' bandages that solve any medical problem short of decapitation or dismemberment but on the bright side, they have solved the manpower issue by quite clearly having invented cloning since every soldier is basically a replica of the previous one but with a different helmet.

You will get absolutely molested in this game if you do not cooperate so, quite quickly you will learn to stop running around like a headless chicken and communicate with your squadmates. You will need to own a role, whether that is shooting, building, driving or spotting. You will learn to support others and enable them to succeed instead of trying to be rambo or the terminator and in due time, you will also learn the burden of command. You will trade your rifle for a pair of binoculars and trust in your team to get the job done by supplying them with whatever they need, from ammo drops all the way to armored vehicles and plane or mortar support. 

Even when you lose a game, you will have gained something. The game succeeds in building camaraderie, it makes you experience how brutal and instantly lethal real war can be and makes you value what little you have to keep yourself alive, namely your senses, your wit and a rifle. 

I'm glad I spent the money on this game, but time will have to prove how committed the devs are in seeing it through and completing our collective wishlist, ultimately producing the best MMO wargame ever. It's not there yet, but it certainly could be. For now, a solid recommendation since there is already a lot to love about it.

Then you turn around & run only to see a pile of soldiers being blown up by an air strike and getting a torso and leg from a comrade hit you in the face LOL.

This game has some serious tactical realism, every class has a specific role and you need to be able to think ahead, flank, cover fire.

Playing this on a good sound system is mental. The sound effects are ultra realistic. 

The game is really well optimised using Unreal engine. 4K120hz will run flawlessly on most high end hardware. Some of the best explosions effects I've seen in a video game.

76561197980169610,275850,True,0.523809552192687988,"No Man's Sky is an absolutely gem of a game. It will be probably be hard to say what hasn't already been said about this game. But I'll try to make it a short and direct review of the game.

For older gamers that grew up in the older PC era and you're familiar with the Elite games (Elite, Frontier: Elite II, Frontier: First Encounters), I think this is THE game you are looking for. This game expands on all of the greatest concepts that Elite introduced, plus adding absolutely tons of ideas to that.

On top of that, the game does a fantastic job NOT overwhelming the player with all of its many features all at once. It slowly introduces you to everything in the game with good pacing.

The developers have taken great care in honing all of the different systems in the game and making everything intuitive. For example, base building. Base building is easy to do, intuitive and works really well.  Or space combat, it has great control and is challenging and fun at the same time. It seems like they really took every single system in the game, and took care to focus on each one with thought and care.  

Play the game at our own pace, work on making some money, or follow story missions, or do side quests, or do government missions, or research new technology for your ship, or go hunt random pirates for cash, or build new vehicles to roam the planet and mine for resources, etc. You get the idea!

And this is maybe a small thing to point out, but having the travel methods so open really does give the player a sense of freedom within the game. For example...Standing at ground level at your base and looking up in the sky, and seeing a planet, then being able to hop in your ship and fly to the planet in real-time, then look back and see the planet you just came from, is a very cool sense of freedom. The same  goes for when you're entering a planet's atmoshere. The fact that you were flying the ship yourself as you enter, not just pressing a button and waiting for the planet to load up, is really huge part of what makes the game so much fun.

Talk about a feature rich game with endless amounts of things to do. This is a must-have game for anyone who likes large space combat/exploration/trading. If this type of game interests you, No Man's Sky does not disappoint!"

No Man's Sky's initial release was an absolute train wreck as we all know, but I will continue to sing Hello Games praise for committing to bringing the game they promised to the world. While it took a great many years to get to this point, I highly recommend this game as much as I possibly can.

If you're not into making your own fun, this game is not for you. Outside of expeditions, you are truly set out in the cosmos to just adventure and see what you discover, with not a single guide.

Refined mechanics, and new features, it aims to deliver an even more immersive and competitive experience. The game continues to focus on squad-based combat in a specific modes, strategic decision-making, and intense gunplay across the...Almazrah!!

76561199540350072,962130,True,0.576380014419555664,"Title: Grounded: The Pinnacle of Gaming Innovation

In the vast landscape of video games, where genres collide and technologies evolve, few titles manage to stand out as truly groundbreaking experiences. Among them, ""Grounded"" emerges as a shining beacon of innovation, seamlessly blending elements of survival, exploration, and adventure into a captivating masterpiece. Developed by Obsidian Entertainment and released in 2020, Grounded not only redefines the boundaries of gaming but also establishes itself as one of the best games ever created.

At its core, Grounded transports players into a world where they are reduced to the size of insects, navigating a backyard filled with towering grass blades and towering obstacles. This unique premise immediately sets the stage for an immersive experience that challenges players to adapt, survive, and thrive in a world where every blade of grass becomes a towering obstacle and every insect a formidable adversary.

One of the most striking aspects of Grounded is its attention to detail and the sheer scale of its world. Despite the diminutive size of the player character, the game world feels vast and teeming with life, from the bustling activity of ants to the majestic flight of dragonflies. Every corner of the backyard is filled with secrets to uncover and challenges to overcome, ensuring that players are constantly engaged and enthralled by the world around them.

Furthermore, Grounded excels in its implementation of survival mechanics, striking a delicate balance between challenge and accessibility. Players must scavenge for resources, craft tools and weapons, and build shelter to survive the harsh realities of the backyard. However, unlike other survival games that can feel punishingly difficult, Grounded provides ample opportunities for exploration and discovery, ensuring that players are always motivated to push forward and uncover the mysteries that lie ahead.

The game's visuals also deserve special mention, as they are nothing short of breathtaking. Despite the technical constraints of rendering a world from the perspective of a tiny insect, Grounded manages to deliver stunningly beautiful environments that are rich in detail and brimming with life. From the shimmering dewdrops on blades of grass to the intricate patterns of a spider's web, every aspect of the game world feels meticulously crafted and lovingly rendered.

However, what truly sets Grounded apart from other games is its emphasis on cooperative multiplayer gameplay. While the single-player experience is certainly enjoyable, it is in multiplayer where Grounded truly shines. Working together with friends to build a base, fend off enemies, and explore the backyard is an experience like no other, fostering a sense of camaraderie and teamwork that few games can match.

In addition to its core gameplay mechanics, Grounded also boasts a compelling narrative that unfolds gradually as players progress through the game. While the story may not be the primary focus of the experience, it serves as a compelling backdrop that adds depth and context to the world around them. From uncovering the mysteries of the backyard to confronting the sinister forces that lurk within, the story of Grounded is both engaging and thought-provoking, ensuring that players are invested in the journey from beginning to end.

In conclusion, Grounded stands as a testament to the power of innovation and creativity in gaming. With its unique premise, engaging gameplay, stunning visuals, and cooperative multiplayer experience, it sets a new standard for excellence in the industry. Whether you're a seasoned gamer or new to the medium, Grounded offers an experience that is truly unforgettable, cementing its status as one of the best games ever created."

I streamed it so I was somewhat wanting to play through and finish it without too much messing around, I completed it in 24 hours. However if I was not streaming I would easily sink 50+ hours into this.
You will find yourself just absolutely stunned at the mechanics, the bond you form with your car and in general just intense as hell survival action.

Except when I'm annoyed at various obstacles that I can't do anything about. I found it to be as fun and frustrating as driving in traffic without the satisfaction of getting somewhere.

sorry for yapping but I like this game."
76561198255810003,1458140,True,0.523809552192687988,"Overall it's fun, but it's VERY buggy and some of the mechanics are quite irritating.

I've never encountered a game so bad at explaining itself, entirely omitting to mention whole mechanics EVER, let alone before you encounter a need to use them - I'd say the abductors warranted some kind of explanation from the radio people and, frankly, not explaining that you have to invent, craft AND carry the anchor radar before you end up in a zone that requires said tool (so resulting in a forced death) is very poor design.

It became altogether too common that, on exiting the car, I'd be transported onto a roof, the vehicle would sink halfway into the earth, or would immediately teleport itself 700m away, and I'd be left holding a door.

The frequency of the 'dim lights while turning' ""quirk"" was near constant, think I had to fix it 20 something times across my play-through. Surely each one once is enough of a novelty?

I loved the atmosphere, the music and the relative sense of adventure when first entering the zone, giving way to a free-form sense of on-the-fly planning to plot your way through to key needed resources across each area to gather what you need most. Some things are unnecessarily difficult to find, and some ""enemies"" are just wildly infuriating.

Oh, and you're giving me a sarcastic ""achievement"" for pressing the gas before shifting to neutral because your crosshair detection isn't very good and you have to hold the button to engage gear? You know what happens in driver's ed if you have to look at the stick every time you want to shift?"
76561198059793052,1458140,True,0.523809552192687988,"I am pleasantly surprised by Pacific Drive! I don't like driving in games so you wouldn't think it would be my thing (much like irl, my driving skills are akin to someone who heavily relies on alcohol to function in their daily life....so not great) but I've been really enjoying this! My one major complaint would be the optimization. My home PC runs this fine (and to be fair it could use some upgrades), my laptop struggles real hard (with med-low settings it runs alright), and the steamdeck...is a nightmare HOWEVER I was able to get it running smoothly on the deck by messing around with some settings, mostly putting less noticeable graphics settings to the lower end and keeping textures on high so the game isn't hideous. I would recommend messing around with settings as it is totally possible to play this on the deck, it's actually the way I have spent most of my time on the game at this point.
Second issue: you cannot save mid runs. This game actually has really great accessibility options for gameplay, you could make it very forgiving (no items lost on death, some items lost on death, menus pause time, invulnerable in menus, invulnerable in general) or very punishing (lose everything on death, menus don't pause, ect...) and I adore that. However, once you leave your garage, you cannot save your game until you go back. The further you get in the game, the rougher this can be. Sometimes I have insanely long drives and unfortunately I do have a job so I can't always commit hours straight to the game without a manual save. I get the intention here but it is something I think the devs should add in their many accessibility features, that way people who enjoy the risk of needing to abandon a run because they have to do things in their actual life, can keep that. Weirdly the steamdeck kinda sorta helps me with this as I can put it in sleep mode and return when I'm able.
I would say the worldbuilding/storytelling is kinda similar to Firewatch in the sense that there are characters moving the story along I don't think we'll ever meet personally (I have not finished the game yet, tho, so what do I know?) but they do a good job of keeping the story & worldbuilding engaging despite this. As well as a lot of recordings and logs to collect. Just genuinely a unique experience I find fun to return to. Can even be spooky at times, too! Being alone on the road is a scary thing.
Gameplay is simple but engaging if you like crafting and making a cool looking car. I guess it would kinda fall into walking sim category for some? I find it relaxing in the same way Powerwash Sim is relaxing. Lots of repetitive tasks but it feels like you are accomplishing something. Good game to switch on some podcasts and chill to, assuming you aren't progressing story. Also really good OST! (You get free pride flag bumper stickers once you unlock the ability to deck out your car btw love that)
Overall would recommend if the gameplay seems fun to you, it's worth your dollar."

76561198059049934,1458140,True,0.516129016876220703,"quite a enjoyable and unique experience

a pity that the endgame gets rather annoying with car parts constantly getting 'worn' without any way to counter it"
76561197971508249,1458140,True,0.513513505458831787,"Pacific Drive is a game that naturally draws comparisons to many, MANY other games and, just like its main character -the car, not the player- seems cobbled together by a bunch of inspirations and manages to carve out its own identity even though at times it will wander off without much direction or grace.

The most direct parallel I could draw for PD (and the most obscure too, because I'm cool like that) would be Jalopy. If you haven't played it, Jalopy is a driving survival-ish game where you and an (your?) uncle will drive through several locations, stopping along the way to replace worn out parts and balancing your precarious budget in order to make it through the game. Well, PD takes this premise and expands on it in pretty much any imaginable way: you are stranded in a closed off area of the US where weird stuff has been going on, and your mission will be to go deeper and deeper into this area, all the while researching, crafting, swapping, repairing and upgrading both your car and the gas station you call home.

The game is effectively split in two sections: ""on the field"" moments where you will be navigating procedurally generated areas, collecting resources and navigating around the terrain and anomalies, and ""at base"" where you will put everything you picked up to good use by unlocking new parts, swapping them, and preparing for your next sortie. There is a surprising amount of stuff to do in the garage, from building your car from a combination of panels, doors and wheels to developing and installing upgrades, detailing your car, and crucially, making sure that your station wagon is in good condition and prepared for your next sortie. 

Once you decide to head out, you will plan your destination and how to get there, carefully considering the conditions of each area in between, and of course, the largest chunk of your time will be spent in the field, planning your route between points of interest and driving as best as possible trying to make it through your route in one piece, then head back to the gas station. The drives can get surprisingly tense, and pulling a trip to its completion does feel very rewarding and satisfying. Sorties can go anywhere from half an hour to up to a few (I'm halfway through the game and expeditions can easily go over 2 hours), and while you might not be in substantial danger for like 95% of your sortie, I would be lying if I said you couldn't track my time played through a heartbeat monitor. PD is not a scary or difficult game, but there's always stakes to every trip, and you will always keep your head on a swivel for any unexpected anomalies and resources, storms and dimensional shifts.

[b]However.[/b]

If you give the negative reviews for this game a glance, you will see that the most common complaint is that PD suffers of quite a bit of bloat, and it's true. The drives themselves aren't hard to pull off at all, and in fact I would say the game is easy to the point that I haven't yet failed to extract a single time in over 20 hours played, and while my car has gotten pretty banged up at times, it is easy to nurse it back to health as long as you can get a hold of the materials. You can craft pretty much any essential tool or even car part on the back of your car, but there's always the risk of getting into a bad spot if you drive like an absolute bozo without the game feeling overly oppressive or frustrating. But as a result, the game can feel really samey: scavenge around a house or two, gather energy, move to the next area. Anomalies are weird and scary at first, but once you learn how they work, most become more of a nuisance than a real danger. And a lot of the story missions will rely on you making repeat trips to the same spot, or going back to base just to go one zone further on the next go. 

The upgrade and crafting system also feels padded out, with some truly baffling design choices like no auto-sort feature on containers. It has the decency to provide a ""move all"" button, and you can craft from storage, which is great, but soon enough your immediate post-trip will consist of running around the shop with your last haul trying to find an empty spot in your different lockers. A lot of the craftables feel sparse and somehow redundant at the same time. PD tries its little heart out to give incentives to go out there and gather energy to use on a tech tree that is very wide, but not very deep: you'll basically unlock the same 4 or 5 variants for each component, and a lot of ""upgrades"" are more arbitrarily tiered sidegrades, sometimes feeling completely redundant.

There is a fascinating, incredibly deep system of ""quirks"" that your car will develop over time, and while some can be infuriating when on the road, it is fun and satisfying to correctly diagnose them. More often than not they will be so harmless and dumb that you might as well not bother, but it is one of the more elaborate systems in the game, and it feels as if the rest of content did not have the chance to develop as much, instead being spread out as much as possible and tying it to ridiculous amounts of resources to try and force the player to grind out trips, or at least going out of their way to look out for them while running story missions. Car upgrades will make your life easier on that aspect, but I would personally enjoy more tinkering around with my car than having to go out and grind out 500 lightning testicles to build this one light rack or whatever.

I'm not going to ask for Mechanic Simulator levels of complexity (or tedium), but there's a lot of granularity that PD could delve into with headlights settings and configurations, suspension, gear ratios, weight distribution and more that it just doesn't touch, and while I understand you have to stop [i]somewhere[/i], I feel they could have fleshed out the vehicle building aspect of the game without necessarily making it too obscure for the casual player, but giving more meat for the tinkering inclined to sink their teeth on.

But anyway, I like the game. It's not hard, but it's not exactly relaxing either. and I'm looking forward to the new anomalies, landscapes and adventures that are left for me to discover. And I know that very probably by the end of it I will want a DLC that just gives me more to do. The game is a joy to play on a Dualsense, supporting both adaptive triggers and haptic feedback (though weirdly, no controller speaker support), and while it's not exactly a paragon in terms of performance or bugs (particularly related to physics), nothing I have come across has yet affected my enjoyment of it massively. If any of this review sounds good to you, you'll probably like it, and you'll probably be left wanting more of it, and in terms of shortcomings, there can be much, much worse ones.

I will never not recommend this game to others, but due to these issues and lack of save game option on the field, I just couldn't finish it. As an adult with limited play time these days, I am not going to pause a game for hours just because of fear of losing progress. I wont thumbs down the review because others may not have an issue with this.

Thumbs up regardless, because the first 15 hours was very fun, and I felt like it was going to be one of my favorite indie games ever made. Also it feels like a new genre of a game, so it has that going for it."

But after a while with the success of the game, you'd expect them to add features that really grasp players to play again, but sadly the updates come VERY far and few between. When there is an update its nothing ""new"" just another resource to collect, a new crafting table to build, and a different thing to grind, while still having to grind previous resources. Not fun for replaying."
76561197990239512,892970,False,0.528985500335693359,"I respect the developers. The game has some quality but I don¬¥t like it. I jus¬¥t can¬¥t get myself to like it. I've already tried giving it a chance on and off for like 5 or 6 times. I could not endure the pain past like the third boss.

The reasons why I could not get myself into liking this game is that the grind is simply the WORST I have seen in any survival game, it's not even funny. Everything takes ages, and it feels like the developers artificially and unnecessarily made everything more cumbersome, scarce and painful just to piss off the players and make them grind for longer than needed.

- The inventory is short and cumbersome;
- the lack of key customizations also add to the pain, like scrolling through the toolbar with mouse scroll. I don¬¥t feel like pressing numeric buttons all the time for swapping between tools, shield+1handed, or bow;
- I understand the design decision of not allowing ores through portals but I think it's a horrible design decision which just inflates the grinding unnecessarily;
- The stash space of each container is a complete joke, it's pure nonsense that you have to construct like 20 basic chests throughout the house in the beginning of the game;
- The walks that you need to do all the time are too long and creeping slow, and using good gear only makes it more slow and painful.

The above are just the ones I remember by now, but they are a complete deal breaker when added up, which is a shame, because I see the game has quality and efforts put into it. I just can¬¥t understand the design philosophies of some developers of deliberately making the player feel miserable while progressing instead of having fun.

A trully wasted potential in my opinion. A handful of good improvements to gameplay and QoL could make this game one of the better survivals. For now, I don¬¥t recommend it unless you like to feel miserable while progressing solo.

76561198016603957,892970,False,0.524616599082946777,"""Brutal"" is an understatement.  
While there are some aspects I love about this game and genre as a whole, I simply can't write a scathing enough review.
It does some things right, and adds a lot of unique mechanics.  Actually experience the new mechanics, and notice a pattern.  They add nothing fun, and are just there to punish the player.
Things I like: Crafting system
Skills that level up with usage
Unlocking recipes as you see new materials

Meh stuff:
Building system is generally ok, but there is no ""snapping to grid"", so no starting from both sides and building towards the middle.  (I.E. a bridge, or a house with 2 people building)

The WTF were you thinking stuff:
Holy F' is it ugly.  Textures are something awful like 200x200 resolution.  Character models are like something from 2001.  Building materials are not seemless and are grating to even look at.
World size is 10x too large, with 99% of it devoid anything useful.  Once you get through a tier, there's no reason to go back... 99% of the world is tiers you don't need anything from.  Imagine running around trying to find a lone person (boss spawn point) in a world the size of texas... no cars/planes/fast movement.
Death penalty didn't seem bad until you get to ""swamp"" tier...  Then you realize it's egregiously bad.
""Wet"" mechanic"" drastically reduces health and stamina regen, making fighting a PITA.  
You're *always* wet in the swamp... and can't run because of water... and can't see because it's always dark.
OMFG is it dark.  With no gamma option (WTF?!?) it's just a black screen at night in most locations.
Cold at night cuts health/stamina regen *dramatically*.  Combined with wet (like swamps) and you simply can't engage in combat.
Nights (cold) are long and days seem too short.  
Because of these mechanics, the most you can travel is half a day before having to turn around and head back to base to sleep.  (Or build bases everywhere changing your spawn point, and *really* screwing yourself over)
Boating: Oh, there's wind!  And it steers based on wind, sounds fun!  Oh WTF... *EVERY* single time I get in my boat wind changes to blow *directly* against where I'm going.  100% of the time.   Almost as if by design.
Oh, there's weather... Rain... Lots of Rain... Making you wet... and unable to fight.
Constant, non-stop spawning of enemies, harassing you.  Can't take two swings of my pickaxe on copper without something attacking me.  At night, it's worse.
There's a vendor... *somewhere* in the giant world... essentially impossible to find.
Resource requirements for building/crafting VS how much you get is some next level trolling.  42 hours of gameplay and we'd just finished up bronze, and got enough iron for a pickax and sword each.
Biomes make combat more and more difficult... not the enemies... the friggen terrrain. Start in meadows, easy.  Then *very* thick forest, always getting stuck on branches, logs, boulders, etc.  Swamp: Always wet, can't run, always dark.  Mountains: can't move because you're basically billy-goating up a sheer cliff... but still getting attacked. Plains: easy again... Mist: Can't see my own da** character because the fog is so thick, and even more rocky than mountains, thicker brush than forest...  The biomes are so poorly thought out that it saps *all* fun out.
Bosses have absolutely *insane* HP even on the lowest difficulty.
Each biome has only the tiniest of new content. 3-5 new enemies.  That's it.

Once we hit the swamp and died 10+ times trying to retrieve our corpse, I turned *all* the difficulty settings to their minimum, set to ""free build buildings"", set resource drops to 3x, set death penalty to min (STILL too harsh), all enemies to passive, and it was ""playable"".  Even with that, the massive world size, terrible biomes, and harsh grinding took all the fun out.

And I'm pretty sure I missed some of the ""Less than horrific"" game mechanics."

After I gave it another chance, it spoiled so many survival game mechanics for me, that I cannot imagine many better survival games out there."
76561198006520779,892970,True,0.523809552192687988,"Right up my alley
-- skill based
-- no gearscores, hosted servers or overwhelming tier grinds like our least fave steampunk survive game that bummed us all out and we are still in a sort of mourning over
-- slow burner
-- I love the art-style and game world graphics ... not for everyone ... it's like updated nostalgia to me
-- great building blocks
-- can crossplay w xbox pals

will be amassing hundreds of hours ... amazing amount of content per dollar.

76561198961257574,892970,False,0.52173912525177002,"The atmosphere, visuals and environments in this game are fantastic. I can not recall how many times I was just standing there gazing upon a beautiful sunset, as sky slowly turns orange and pink and light rays slowly fade inside a forest and dense fog comes and claims the land. The feeling you have while sitting in a comfy house during a heavy storm making some simple food over the fireplace. Or discovering misty shores and strange islies for the first time. Yeah, that game captures all these feelings really well. But...
Most if not all positive points end here.
The gameplay is grind in Valheim. Punishing, unforgiving. You have to grind a colossal amount of resources to make small progress. My friend and I managed to deal with Swamp, Mountains and Steppes biomes and even had some fun while doing so. Up until the moment we reached Mistlands and realized it's grind x 50 and punishment x 100. We tried, but that was too much, the fun was gone, we are going to need to do the same things we've already done 3 times in other biomes BUT this time it's 1001% more tedious.
After playing Conan Exiles for some time, I will not recommend Valheim because the developers' definition of fun is grind, constant punishment, unfair enemies and the most boring boss fights I've ever seen. You are going to need to pay me if you want me to install and play Valheim again, because the grind is a full-time job here."

I broke my hand and couldn't play though for 2 and a half months, so, when I returned I could see the changes in snipers, gameplay, etc. 

Still, this is a super fun game and the devs have put in a lot of love and attention. 

For people that are interested to get in, be aware, it will be hard in the start!!!! Most of the players online are experienced!

But, if you keep it up, you will find your class and play style and then it can go wild, like playing a marksman class with a dual scoped G3 assault rifle and finding your self switching from scope to scope and from single fire to full auto! 

PS. For the DEVS. Besides gameplay and how to get people into the game, please look into adding some way for us to create presets :) It's a pain in the butt to change uniforms and guns to adjust all the time :P Easy feature :P"

As for help playing the game, the tutorial isn't even done, and doesn't cover vehicles, building, or any of the many important things that you need to know just to play. Looks like this core part of the game wont be done anytime soon, either! Because right now, the priority for the next update is on new maps. Oh boy!
Unfortunately, there are still problems with other existing content that the devs seem uninterested in developing as well, such as:
*There is almost no reason to use any rocket launcher other than HEAT rounds
*No shotguns. if its not an automatic weapon, its a sniper or a pistol, making gameplay stale
*Cannot modify loadouts unless you are in a game
*Cheating players easily evade reports or kicks by simply not being in the player list
*There is no way to tell who is saying what in mic chat, leading to you having to mute everyone within earshot because one person is playing music (this is more common than you might think).
Its fun for a bit, but once you get the hang of things, you'll see whats lacking fairly soon. I hope this game comes out in the next 3 years so I can change my opinion on what might be a well polished product at that time, but I can also hope for a million dollars and a pony made of diamonds, and still expect it about the same."

It look's way nicer than it needed for this game to work, the nature is pretty and factories take on a strange beauty as well, in part because of the great lighting and reflections. It's incredibly satisfying to plan and build a factory and then watch as the materials roll in, only to be driven, flown, or trained to another factory to create a bigger more complicated component. The movement with the bionic legs is also really slick, and the fights are fast paced and exciting. This game is more than worth it at full price, so if it's on sale it's a no brainer to pick it up.

I started with Update 8 and the full release is next, but it already feels complete.  Honestly, it doesn't need a story, its just fun to build factories.  And troubleshoot factories.  And wonder why your production is flapping, then figure out you forgot to load the manifold because you were lazy and didn't do a load-balancer configuration.  Then try and figure out how to hide your wires and spend way too much time on cosmetics...

On a technical note, the game performs very well given the things it needs to keep track of, there must be some clever way they're rendering item position on conveyor belts.  The fluid dynamics are fun and introduce challenges that need to be solved with head lift and pumping.  Then troubleshooting plumbing.  Then realizing you hit pipe capacity and need to branch to get fluid down further.  Then ruin the whole thing.  Then rebuild it better but forget one minor detail that ruins your layout right at the end.

76561198011094835,2369390,False,0.523809552192687988,"Ah, the familiar, trodden path.

We've been here before. 

Many times, in fact.

Why, it's been a decade. 

""Let's eat here,"" I tell my girlfriend. ""I've had food from here before, and look - it's Gus Fring!"" I can't resist the siren call of Los Pollos Hermanos, and Giancarlo Esposito. He's beautiful. I can't believe he hasn't been named the sexiest man of the century. My heart weeps at the injustice of it.

""He's the new villain. Maybe it'll be good.""

We get to our table and are seated by the maitre'd. A smartly dressed Corporate executive. 
""Your order will be with you momentarily,"" he turns away and disappears beyond the fog wall of the Internet.  ""Ding! Download completed!"" I start the game.

Sorry, we missed a step along the way. What I meant to say is that I start ""uplay"", possibly everyone's favourite game distribution platform on the Internet. I must confess: uplay definitely didn't impact my decision to wait for this game to be dirt cheap before purchasing it. This is the most fun I've had in ages: everyone loves uplay, everyone loves launching launchers from launchers. I really think that Ubisoft hasn't gone far enough. I think we can all agree the experience would be enhanced if they included a Farcry series launcher that launches every time you launch a Farcry game. Once the launcher-ception is over, we finally start the game.
....
...... and the fun stops. The characters are ripe, runny turds squeezed out by interns squatting in bathroom stalls. You could replace them with planks that have silly faces drawn on them and the story would be more compelling. ""Don't worry,"" Ubisoft's writers assure us. ""We've included the word ""guerrilla(s) 9827 more times in the script. It gets better."" That's good writing there: it's important that every character says the word ""guerrilla"" at least once per sentence, because if they didn't, you wouldn't understand what was going on.

The maitre'd peeks expectantly at us as we continue to eat. The SFX sounds like it was  recorded in the same bathroom, there's something distinctly off about everything. It's unsatisfying. Like a weak 'plop' of a nugget into the toilet after the strained bowel movement that leaves you sweaty, panting,  and the veins on your forehead bulging. There's no splash. Just the pitiful 'plop' failure.

""Don't worry,"" says Ubisoft. ""We were praised for adding new ammo types. We've really changed things up."" They haven't. It's the same shell of a good game, but the instead of fancy ranch dressing you get runny anal-slop. Enemies soak up bullets. They deploy comical looking portable defences. Thank God for the new ammo types. In 2024, I can play a game made in 2021 that feels like it's *finally* catching up to game mechanics from 1994. I'm over the moon.

 ""I know what will make this better,"" I tell my girlfriend. I'd dump me if I asked me to play this, but here she is.  ""Drugs!"" But even the staggering amount of drugs I consume only dulls the sharp edges of the monotony. Substance abuse ends up being disappointing, merely by being experienced in proxy with what's on the screen. I have more fun retching into a toilet than I do playing the game.

We discover a plane; we re-enact some of histories greatest moments. I see the black, greasy stain of an oil spill on the ocean. Immediately I'm put to mind of what Ubisoft ""Farcry"" has become: a murky, greasy stain upon the companies reputation. We fly towards the tank at the center of the environmental catastrophe to investigate.

The game ends. Our characters are on a beach, basking in the sun, getting drunk. Gustavo Fring can have Fantasy-Cuba. We learn - through a broadcast playing in the background - that our 'friends' have all been killed. We'll never have to listen to them say 'guerrilla' again.

For the first time in my life, I offer a prayer of thanks to the Almighty.

I won't be coming back this way again.

Not only is the content far less than its predecessor, but charging $40 for 10 hours of gameplay is criminal. The main house you return to by default is buggy, and has random un-swept leaves teleport through the floor every time I return. 

The upgrade system was so hindered, it may as well be removed from the game. You automatically start with the best window scraper tool with no upgrade options, making every window clean in like 3-5 swipes. From a dev stand point, this is at least partially reasonable, as long as the core demographic did not respond well to the upgrade system. But, if that is the case, remove it entirely. I am fully upgraded and done with the story, within 10 un-optimized hours of just chilling and playing. Not even close to a $40 experience...

The flaws I describe may be minor, but combined with a $40 price tag, makes it all unreasonable. This is at best, a $15-$20 game, in its current state. Sorry devs. I do look forward to your future titles, and you normally put a lot of care into your games, but this particular title just does not hit right compared to the 30+ hours of fun the first title brought me.

[h2] Gameplay [/h2]
In the beginning of the game you barely dare to leave the protection of the Marrows (the starting archipelago) to fish for bigger fish, and you're always back home at dusk... The fear of the fog and the dark is taught to you by the game in a very subtle way, without getting you in too much real danger ingame, it's really amazing! With time and upgrades you venture farther from home, and the game starts to shift more towards lore and completion, with 174 species of fish to catch in various places and ways, and then there's all the aberrations to find as well to complete your encyclopedia, a horrific yet fun adventure! :)
[h2] Lore [/h2]
The game is very lore-rich, and while I haven't read too much by H.P. Lovecraft I can definitely see why it falls under ""Lovecraftian"", especially after completing the game... The twisted fish you pull from the brine, the eyes watching you in the dark and, of course, tentacles... The game would work without the lore as well as a relaxing fishing simulator, but it's what really makes the game pop for me, and I'm sure I'll remember it for quite a while! The finale of the game is great, I didn't see an important plot twist coming at all...

Yeah, this is pretty triumphant in rhythm games. Kinda pricey, so it's best to get it on sale for like $8 instead of $50. Same goes for the DLCs. Unless you have a lot of money or really want to play this game, wait for a sale. If you don't believe me, look at the price of the complete edition of the game when it isn't on sale.

The music variety alone in the base game and all of the DLCs is amazing. There's no way you will hate every song in this game. The difficulties are 4 keys, 5 keys, 6 keys, and 8 keys, each with 4 subcategories of difficulty (not all songs have every sub difficulty though for each). There are also chaos modifiers, which make the game ridiculous. You can also change the speed of the notes.

[h2] Clear Pass [/h2]
It also has a ""Clear Pass"" (basically a battle pass system) that you can earn free and premium rewards for. You progress by completing levels (without the premium and point boosts, this is PAINFULLY slow, have fun grinding). The premium upgrade is $15, but it usually goes on sale when a new season comes out for like $12.49. You're paying $15 for 30 extra rewards and more points after you clear a level (about 500 extra per play). There's also a points booster for like $10 or something, which is available in a bundle with the premium pass for like $21 total, and if you are impatient with grinding, get the booster. It gives you like 2800 extra points per level.

[h2] Modes [/h2]
So, you're probably going to spend like 90% of your time in FREESTYLE mode, which is just solo play. ONLINE mode is from what I understand a battle mode? I haven't touched it yet so I can't really say much about it. AIR is like a live radio system, where you can have songs autoplay or you can play the song. The main difference with it is that the songs are random, and refresh every minute, and there's 3 different difficulties. Also, messages from people all around the world appear during the song, which is cool to see, and you can even write your own. COLLECTION is just basically what you have, whether it be achievements or gallery art or anything else pretty much (which you earn by playing songs in the base game or in DLCs). The gallery is awesome cause you get art of the game in HD. MISSION is basically preset playlists to challenge you. And RANKING is just, where people are ranked. Overall, great variety.

76561199512158670,1407200,False,0.613615453243255615,"Complete honest review here of a player who has been playing since 2011 on my wargaming account, not my steam account. Probably over 4000 hours in total.

This game at one point was a really good game, well balanced and well liked. However, I regret to say that the parent company wargaming have given into the usual corporate greed that comes with owning a one of a kind game like world of tanks, and I recommend you avoid this game entirely.

Lets start with wargaming's way of monetising this game.
Premium account time to make grinding up tech trees quicker.
Premium vehicles which earn more credits and free experience faster.
And Gold to be used to purchase both of these or in-tech tree premium vehicles.

Overall not a bad scope to choose for a F2P game, however the way it is handled is so anti-consumer that it has gotten to the point that the game feels terrible to play at tier 6 all the way to tier 10.

The only thing that is not terrible is Premium account. Its not a necessity, but its a nice to have and isn't needed. It can be bought whenever for however long you want pretty much. Just a week? No problem. A month? Sure!
My problems arise when it comes to the premium vehicles in this game.

New premium vehicles are released in gambling boxes. That is right, that cool premium you are interested in which is coming to the game? You have to gamble in boxes that cost upwards of 50 euros to get the guaranteed chance of one of the vehicles. And it has a chance of being one that you don't even want!
This is such a predatory way of selling new premiums, as players who want specific vehicles may have to purchase 50 of these boxes up to 6 or even 7 times to get the vehicle they want. This would be upwards of 350 euros, or even more.
It is just ridiculous.

Oh yeah, and to add fuel to the fire, newer premium vehicles are, in almost every single way, better than the previous premium vehicles added to the game. Lets use some examples.

The IS-6 was one of the first premium tier 8 vehicles in World of Tanks. Was considered strong but not overpowered once added. It has lacklustre dpm, solid armour and good mobility with a nice set of HP and Alpha damage for the time. A fun vehicle with weak spots that you can shoot and counter while also fighting against it.

Enter a recent premium, the BZ-176 (we all saw this one coming if you even spent a little bit of time at tier 8.)
Better armour than tier 10 heavy tanks like the FV215b? Yep.
Tier 10 howitzer on a tier 8 vehicle which can pen almost anything with the HESH shell? Yep.
Ridiculously high alpha damage on top of it? Yep.
The weakspots? The same size as a helium atom pretty much. Impossible to hit unless you strike pure luck with RNG.
""Your old premium tank is useless! Gamble for a new one in the Lunar Lootboxes!"" - Wargaming.

Next up, the meta of world of tanks:
Sitting in one spot and waiting for the enemy to get impatient while you sit hull down not being able to shoot their weakspots because they are so small that you just miss constantly.
There is no fun involved at high tier because its just... sit in a hull down spot and bounce shots til someone gets lucky.
Its just stale and boring as hell, and what makes this worse is that it has been this way for the better part of a decade.

TL;DR:
Locks vehicles behind gambling mechanics, horrible meta which hasn't changed for a decade now, and parent company refuses to balance reward vehicles or premium vehicles so the game constantly gets power crept.

Never play this pile of shit wargaming calls a ""game."""

I should have stayed away and thankfully realized this before even the 300 game mark. If you want to play with tanks you mainly have three option; War Thunder, WOT, or WOT Blitz. They all share poor matchmaking, team imbalance rolls, and overpowered premium tanks, so no avoiding that. Highlights below:

War Thunder: It takes patience to camp and not run out and get one-shot due to the realistic nature of it, yet it is incredibly  satisfying to one-shot others and the game play is quite complex. It also allows you to take a break from tanks and go fly a plane or drive a ship. It even enables you to play combined game modes where you can play between the three (just not ships and tanks, like that's a fair fight?...) You also get more than one ""life"" per game which is neat. The game was initally developed more so as a simulation-based platform, not really an arcade game so take that as you will. Overall, steep learning curve and not for those who want to run around aimlessly blowing stuff up.

WOT: Tanks only. Plus SPGs (artillery) that can shoot anywhere on the map and takes out chunks of your health or even one shots you. Lemming game play where if all teammates go to one side then it often leads to a loss. Has a decent communication hotkey system. Premium tanks' game influence are nerfed more so due to the clicking arty. Crew member mastery is a bit ridiculous and is a crazy time sink as their training dictates the base performance of your tank. In addition, the time sink deepens because if you want to transfer the crew to another tank then there is a penalty for not being ""trained"" for that tank AND even more so if it is another type of tank (light vs heavy vs medium vs tank destroyer vs arty). Oh, and crews are only limited to the nation... Yikes. Overall, arty can either save you in games or make you want to uninstall, huge credit grind to fight the crew management time sink, however the game overall feels the most balanced and probably opts for the most strategy.

WOT Blitz: Take WOT, but make everything faster, shrink the map, and REMOVE arty. Much more of an arcade shooter feel. Note that without the arty that premium tanks can definitely carry a match and one person being afk or terrible has much more influence on each match. Another big difference with Blitz is that the crew management system is MUCH better as there is no crew switching required. All tanks are given their own crew and share one massive xp pool among your account, not even limited to a nation. You can train skills to help performance in a medium tank while using another tank type and all crew bonuses apply to ANY tank that you drive... pretty freaking sweet. Forgiving game play overall and if you die early on the matches are much faster so it will not belong before you are cruising along again.

Verdict: War Thunder if you prefer a challenge and realistic game play OR WOT Blitz if you want to play tanks and blow stuff up. You'll just rage quit and build up more stress from WOT than what you were trying to relieve beforehand. Have fun."
76561198100201577,1407200,False,0.557894766330718994,"This is a game to be avoided for most people, especially those that want to play it entirely free.

Don't get me wrong, the game is fun. The highs are very high. They are, however, fairly infrequent for the average player. The game lures new players in with lots of free stuff and matches against bots that are quite easy. The further you go, however, the worse it becomes. 

There are several issues with the balancing of the game. Firstly, the matchmaking. Now I will admit, this is a very difficult game to matchmaking right. But being forced to frequently play against higher tier tanks is exhausting. There are often times when lower tier tanks are simply incapable of doing anything for entire matches and it isn't a good feeling. The matchmaking also doesn't seem to effectively take into account all of the various different aspects it needs to such as tank compositions and player ranks. At the very least, the matchmaking is simply not felt by the player from game to game. It is almost always a stomp in one direction or the other, and neither are satisfying. 

Premium tanks are an absolute scourge. They are almost always superior to other tanks, and by significant margins. Unfortunately, Wargaming has a policy against nerfing premium tanks. This has resulted in multiple problematic tanks that have been controlling games for, in some cases, 5+ years without hardly being touched (if at all). 

This is compounded by the abundance of premium ammo spammers in the game. By allowing premium ammo to have by far the best stats in every way, you are essentially able to simply pay for better damage in games. It was a problem when premium ammo was for gold only, but now with its abundance, it is even more so of an issue. I understand the need for something similar in the game, to try and help balance out the fact that tanks are often encountering others tiers above them. However, allowing the rounds to have both higher penetration and damage in so many cases means they are simply better in almost every scenario with zero downsides. In most games, you will encounter players spamming premium ammo against tanks 2 tiers below them. That does not feel good to play against. 

This is likely all intentional. Wargaming makes a lot of money off of premium tanks and premium ammo, and I suspect they intend to keep it that way at the cost of player enjoyment (save of course for players that eagerly spend money on the game to get access to the most overpowered tanks and use the most expensive ammo casually). It is an absolute shame, because the game is genuinely fun when you get a good and balanced match. Having a close match in World of Tanks, where it all comes down to the wire and it could go either way, is incredibly fun and satisfying regardless of which team ends up winning. The new player experience is tailored to turn enticing gameplay into absolute torture, unless you decide to spend large quantities of money on the game.

I understand that the game is free-to-play. They have to monetize the game somehow. But the reality is, they already do in ways that don't directly impact the balancing of the game. In fact, just about every facet of the game is monetized. Customization? Monetized. Currencies? Monetized. Balancing? Monetized. Expedited progress? Monetized. Some of these are fine of course, but making the game a pay-to-win playground is not the way to go.

Finally, I just want to be clear that this doesn't mean anyone should go shouting at the devs or hurling obscenities their way. Not only is that just a messed up thing to do, it does absolutely nothing except anger the people that are trying to build something you enjoy. Most of these decisions get made by the executives of these companies, who only see money and nothing else. And either way, harassing someone over a video game is just ridiculous. I shouldn't have to say all this, but in this day and age, I feel it's necessary. 

If you want to try to push through it and get what you can out of the game, more power to you. I get enough out of the game that I can sometimes have fun. But I simply cannot in good conscience recommend World of Tanks to any new player.  There are alternatives to the game that simply do a better job balancing and would likely be more enjoyable for new players. I would highly suggest that potential new players find other suitable games until Wargaming eventually (hopefully) gets the balancing sorted out."

In this game there are two factors. There is premium shells with higher armour penetration, and there is consumables which increases the performance of your crew. You aim, reload and drive faster.
This is of course extremely expensive to use, and a lot of people do just that.
Means you're basically required to use them if you want to compete.
To be able to afford this, you're basically required to invest into premium tanks or something else to earn the credits needed.

You can fight vs the same tank and not lose to skill, but loosing to the fact the other player could afford a performance boost you could not.

Is the game fun. Difficult question, i'd say it was more fun when premium shell cost gold and added consumables. Why? 
Because you were fighting on equal terms, tanks performed the same, it required more skill to find and hit weak spots. Now, you just run consumables and spam some premium shells. The same skill level is not required.

The kickoff hits the crossbar on the goalpost and hits the returner in the head. The game treats it as a touchback but the announcer is yelling about how the returner's muffed the kick. Meanwhile, his two closest blockers run into each other, one gets knocked to the ground, and the other raises his hand like, ""Sorry, man! Didn't see you there.""

But there is a very playable game here. I'm not multiplayer or MUT or any of that. I'm a franchise player through and through. And it's... not bad. The AI isn't brilliant and it's impossible to set the gameplay sliders to simulate an NFL experience. Essentially every game I find myself thinking, ""This is the one I lose,"" as the AI keeps it close, competitive, and exploits my team's weaknesses out of the gate. The first quarter ends (I play 60 minute games) with my opponent up by 3. But then it falls apart and I win by 50+. 

But that winning by 50+? It's actually fun. Each play is contested, at least a little. If you try the same play over and over - offense or defense - the AI will adjust. 

Are there problems? Heck yeah! You have to adjust the gameplay sliders to compensate for an AI that will basically teleport defenders into pass coverage, spin and juke through a wall of defenders, and complete passes that defy the laws of physics. (Running hard one way, throwing the ball 50 yards the opposite direction without turning, stuff like that). The AI has no idea what Intentional Grounding is. There's a long list detailed by other reviewers.

But if you aren't trying to recreate the Sunday NFL experience, if you treat it like a video game, it can be fun. I have 137 hours in at this writing and I'll probably add 137 more. Should my experience suddenly tank or I end up deciding I hate it instead, I'll change my review.

-Wide variety of vehicle styles
-really nice art style (animated and ""real life"" elements were a great idea), 
-fun and easy driving model,
-awesome music (well, around half of it)
-plot with a ""time limit"" is a new idea, I like it

Where it fails:
-Small number of races (you can race in different classes of cars but it's still the same race), 
-difficulty level and catch-up mechanics are broken (sometimes it's easy even on hard, sometimes it's impossible on easy, game seems to pick one driver that will be faster than you no matter what, unless you figure out which one it is and wreck them. I usually play medium or hard in arcade racers, here I had to settle for easy) 
-tuning the car means nothing (rating is meaningless for you, some cars just feel better even with a lower rating, old Porsche 911 is the biggest offender, then again if your rating is lower than opponents, AI probably is gonna smoke you unless your crash them)
-drifting is unpredictable and offroad doesn't exist (some cars drift better tuned for grip, you have to blindly test what works for your car, cars tuned for road can drive just fine offroad, no reason to tune a car for offroad, there aren't even any offroad races, Heat did it way better)
-colleting heat in the daylight limits you massively when exploring the map, again, Heat did it better.

Honorable mentions for cringy writing and car mods (especially poor Nissan Fairlady) but that's to be expected from NFS.

76561198804997144,1240440,False,0.525862038135528564,"Before I start the review, please know that I've been playing this game through the Xbox app and completed the campaign from Game Pass. Xbox app is an awful excuse of a launcher and kept getting corrupted multiple times, so despite what it says on Steam stats, I have been playing this game for over 2 years in multiplayer.

While the campaign is good and deserves to be played through multiple times, the multiplayer is the mode that keeps this game alive. Given the state of 343i around the release of this game, I don't expect any kind of DLC, expansion or updates to the campaign. For multiplayer, if you're from the Americas or Europe, you'll have a great time with the game. But if you're from outside of those regions, you'll have a very poor experience in multiplayer because of the extremely strict SBMM.

I always play to win and get very competitive, which makes the matchmaking system to put significantly lower tier players in my team, or pit me against significantly better opponents, or both at once if somehow I get a good game. Because of the low player population outside of Americas and EU, the existing players are put into lobbies with >200ms ping. And if you're a better than average player, the SBMM system expects you to balance out bad players, or check if you can take on even better players or get knocked down.

For my experience, all of the above problems have resulted in waiting for over 10mins for every game that's not featured or in the top of the list, only to be put in a lobby with >200ms ping. Because of the PvE modes that were added much later from release, some players from other regions have come back but only play PvE because it's the only decent experience. The weekly Ultimate Challenges require PvP and it's a chore to complete them."
76561198074858016,1240440,True,0.524705410003662109,"Halo: Infinite is a unique case. What started off as a total nightmare with no free-to-play motivation, is attempting to redeem itself through a regular set of updates. These updates have granted a new set of ideas to the franchise which in my opinion help greatly.

Let's just get this out of the way, this isn't exactly a Halo game in the traditional sense, It's not a well developed story about a heroic cypher for the player being led through a rich story by a lovable AI guide. It's a cosmetics grinding simulation with Halo shooting mechanics. But with that being said Infinite currently feels like a team of developers trying to make a reasonable pass at a grindcore game with a suit at Microsoft mandating corporate policy. 

There's a battle pass, there's a ""premium currency store"", there's daily challenges and challenge based progression to slow down earning, increasing playtime. All the hallmarks of a corporate ""live service"" so they don't have to deliver a ""product"".

Contrary to that point, the developers appear to have made logical choices, by making each battlepass replayable, you don't have to complete 100 levels of nonsense within a tiny timeframe, you can start any battlepass from now or the past at any time, even switch between different tracks of rewards without losing progress. 

Free content is the forefront of each pass, with all free items being given to you first. Meaning you only have to play 25 levels to complete each pass as a free player. Oh and PVE is a part of the regular MP experience. You don't have to fight over players now to earn XP, you can just play HALO now. 

These are all massively positive changes which in their wisdom, have pushed me BACK INTO INFINITE. 
Yes, I will be playing this game to reward these developers with my time, money and patience. Playing the games which make good choices to adapt to rules made by those above them, will greatly encourage developers and publishers to make positive choices!

Infinite made me ask questions: ""Hold on, wait a minute, why can't I complete a battle pass in any other game like I do in Halo Infinite?"", ""Why can't I play old passes in other games?"", ""Why don't other games give players access to PVE as part of the free-to-play experience?"". Seems someone, probably a gameplay designer, at 343 does indeed know what they are doing, it's just a shame they're working for 343 of all companies. 

I'd love to see this concept of being able to come back to games, of which I haven't played for months, to find a whole trove of content for me to play through and earn, rather than being shamed for missing it!

Now, with that being said, this recommendation is only to be taken if you're the kind of person who can switch your brain off, ignore all reason, story or character and just click on alien heads. You have to be a special kind of person to really just enjoy the ""combat"" part of Halo over all of the other pieces, but that is indeed the hill that 343 plans to die on. A combat system from 2001 that they didn't invent."
76561198255798250,1240440,False,0.523809552192687988,"Probably one of the weakest entries in the series, and I played Spartan Assault. 

Pros: 

-Decent Campaign
-Fun Multiplayer
-While different, Competitive is just as good as Halo 5's. More akin to Halo 3, but a little faster paced.
-Customization feels great
-The best forge in the series
-Season Passes don't leave. You can do any of them you want, no FOMO for being gone for a Season.
-New Player Friendly
-It's Free

Cons:

-Correlation to previous games campaigns is just... Obsolete. Like someone pushed the reset button. Halo 5's Campaign was bad, but at least it tried to build a connection - even if it was poorly done. Infinite wipes almost everything that happened.
-Thought the game would tie into the Banished more, one of the most amazing defacto factions that was introduced in Halo Wars 2. However, almost nothing is utilized from them and the vehicles/enemies just feel like a Reskin with a design slapped on. Once again, the famous Scarab fights cease to exist and Liches haven't been used since their first entry since Halo 4.
-Customization, while there and incredibly well done, is very hardly pushed by Microtransactions. Want to look unique? Buy from the store. Want even more unique looks? Buy the Battle Pass that's specific to the Core.
-After 2 Years, the servers are awful and the desync is insane.
-The Content is... Bad. Devs put more time into their store in a single season, than a single game mode. (Seriously, who would want to wait 6-months for one game mode that came at launch with all previous titles? 1-Flag CTF and Infection has been around since Halo 3 in every game)
-The Dev stance around Multiplayer Maps is a joke. The hard push on MTX for their store, you would think would go towards development and support for the Community. Not really, almost every map is made by the Community (Who do amazing work, btw.) But the Devs themselves would rather you do it for them, than put in the effort themselves. The best they can do is... A game mode, and selecting maps people like to put into Matchmaking. 
-Ground Based Combat focused. Halo has always been about Power Weapons and Vehicles. Now every single vehicle is shredded faster than a Mongoose head first into a boosting Wraith. To top it off, they nerfed the Plasma Pistol which was an annoying, but balanced slow projectile that stunned Vehicles (No longer EMP's vehicles, just shields) and instead added a ton of weapons that are all anti-vehicle. Ever want your Warthog to stop driving every 2 seconds? Well now you can. They added high-velocity projectiles and hitscan Snipers/Sidearms (and more!) so your Warthog and Tanks will never be able to give you an edge to push anywhere outside your side of the map! (Also where tf is the Mantis? That was like 343's signature vehicle since they took over.)

Overall, good to pickup and play the Campaign if you want to continue the storyline. Recommend waiting to get it on Sale. Multiplayer is okay. Had a better time with LSD in a Haunted House during Halloween than I did playing this games version of Firefight."

76561199369638487,678950,True,0.5695839524269104,"Everyone who likes to read manga may know Akira Toriyama (April 5, 1955 ‚Äì March 1, 2024). 
He was a Japanese manga artist and character designer. He created popular manga series Dr. Slump, before going on to create Dragon Ball (his most famous work) and also designed characters for several popular video games such as the Dragon Quest series, Chrono Trigger, and Blue Dragon.

As we all knew, the Dragon Ball franchise has so many video games with bits and pieces of storyline taken straight from the anime or the manga as well. Feels so great to becoming one of our favorite characters among so many within Kakarot aka Son Goku's universe.

The gameplay is more like 2D fighting but still awesome and the environments can be destroyed making each matches feels like a battle between gods (...or goddesses) so powerful they can even break a full continent.

Personally, my favorite is the very first Dragon Ball when Goku was still just a kid with a tail, first time meeting Bulma, fighting the Red Ribbon Army. And then when he become a family man (just like Guile from SF2) the story becoming more action packed full of battles. I stopped following right after the Majin Buu's arc, because no matter what, the good guys will always win.

Dragon Ball is part of a childhood, it can also be a familiar best friend during any mature readers' dark times. Has lots of moral values that some may teach us to be brave and never back down to anything but stay rational. Defend the weak and never give up easily because there are always better solutions for each problems. 

Dragon Ball is for all of us. And its legacy will lives on.

I've realized how much I appreciate DBZ and the influence it has had on manga, anime, other creators and the world on a global scale. I'm a major Sonic the Hedgehog fan and without DBZ there would be no Super Sonic form or the transformation from collecting 7 Chaos Emeralds nor the character dynamic between modern Sonic and Shadow since it's heavily inspired by Goku and Vegeta. I've been a casual fan of Dragon Ball but I've always enjoyed the sections of the story I've caught. This is one badass fighting game too in the style of an 'anime' and Marvel VS Capcom fighter. High speed and high flying with extreme impact and action. It captures the show's spectacular battles incredibly well! I'm inspired to go back and rewatch the whole Dragon Ball series now because of it! Highly recommend this game to any fighting game fans or casual DBZ watchers!"

76561198030752353,107410,True,0.973724424839019775,"Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that it‚Äôs developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But it‚Äôs even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. 

At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the game‚Äôs complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your ass depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. 

Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3‚Äôs two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as I‚Äôm stuck on one mission that I simply can‚Äôt seem to complete.)

However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves.

Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). I‚Äôm sure there are so many others that I haven‚Äôt even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game.

In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless.

76561198031889408,107410,True,0.958130419254302979,"Been playing ARMA for almost 10 years now. It‚Äôs grown alongside me, and has created some of the most memorable moments I‚Äôve ever experienced in a videogame. It‚Äôs one of those games which, when it finally ‚Äòclicks‚Äô with you, never quite leaves you. You always find yourself going back to it. It‚Äôs not a game which necessarily empowers you like DOOM or Wolfenstein, but the pay-off from successfully pulling off that mission, that flank, that firing solution, that landing, even that single shot, is unparalleled. 

I‚Äôll always remember the moody fog of the APEX Protocol co-op missions as me and my friend crawled through the jungle, silently taking out patrols hunting for us with flashlights dancing in the dark. I‚Äôll always remember finally Escaping from Tanoa after six hours with my mates ‚Äî it felt like a hiking trip by the end. I‚Äôll always remember staying prone in a ghillie suit as a whole platoon of Russians patrolled past my squad, just like in All Ghillied Up. No other game can recreate the thrill or complexity of these memories in an emergent and inherently personal manner. 

My friends and I, after ten years, have talked for hours about that one mission which went so wrong or that incredible shot one of us made across a whole valley, or just how much we associate some terrains like Sahrani or Stratis with our first years as teenagers back at school. ARMA, for me, is an experience equal in its thrills and frustrations as it is in its nostalgia ‚Äî you come to learn these towns, these fields, these roads and valleys and recall them each as affectionately as the other. Sure, things go wrong: a miscommunication is made, a helicopter crashes, the physics engine freaks out, or the server messes up, but most of the time, you‚Äôll laugh through it. 

ARMA is unlike any other game ‚Äî any other experience. I think this ramble has been quite open in displaying just how much it means to me, and how much it will continue to mean to me. I can assure you, if you give it a chance, it will quickly mean as much to you too."

+ Extremely mod friendly; enjoys full support from the Steam Workshop
+ Visuals & environmental design, save for a few issues here and there (i.e. empty buildings), has largely aged well & looks fantastic
+ Employs a deeply challenging level of realism
+ Multiplayer is still very active; boasts a wonderful variety of gameplay & modded servers to choose from
+ Long, content-packed single player campaign; player choices do affect potential endings, as there are several
+ Time control is back from Arma 2; player can speed up the passage of time, which helps SIGNIFICANTLY to combat the monotony of walking/running very long distances between objectives
+ Enormous map/playable area
+ User-created scenarios & a very easy-to-use scenario creator
+ Boasts incredibly varied gameplay mechanics; from piloting/driving myriad vehicles & gunships, to underwater missions, & everything in-between
+ Map & squad mechanics are back; while they may feel clunky to use in a combat scenario, a little practice goes a long way & serves to open up a slew of options on the battlefield

- Sound design is very hit & miss; some weapons sound identical to others, & vehicle sound effects tend to sound strangely muted
- Dialogue is also hit & miss; while I found the voice-acting to be done largely well, some of the dialogue is a bit awful
- Soundtrack often felt cheesy or inappropriate
- Mission pacing often feels very uneven; I felt that it often leaned too far into the realm of the tedious in the interest of realism (shouldn't be a bad thing in theory, but for the pruposes of a video game, it can put players to sleep in some missions)
- The initial learning curve is considerable, & the tutorial felt inadequate overall; mechanics are amazing on paper, but take an inordinate amount of time to master

Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality. There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release.

One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s.

As we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon. We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols. Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower.

There I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower. I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position. But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed.

As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive.

Falling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command. I had done it. I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive.

That is what this game is about."

What Im trying to say is: ARMA is not a game, simulation or the answer to the question: How can I commit a war crimes but not be punished for it. Its the friends we made a long the way to commit those war crimes, every flipped convoy that ruins the operation 15 minutes from starting, its the AI shooting your though 30 layers of foliage, its the enemy artillery firing once but the shell exploding 6  times over a 3km radius, every new guy throwing a grenade under your feet while you play dress up in the arsenal, laughing your ass off as your Zeus tries to spice things up with roll playing, crying as Zeus retaliates for killing his roll play doll for ""lols"", every insane AT shot made by one of your guys, every terribly fired RPG you did, its every time the AI some how flanked you and every time you fight your way though it.

edit: this is a cry for help"
76561198007471493,107410,True,0.94609987735748291,"Where do I start with Arma 3...

 1st of all, have I played enough of this game? No, not in the slightest. My total playtime (see above) is pathetic in comparison to those around me. I see upwards of 2000, 3000, 4000 hours just looking at the reviews currently. At the time of writing this review, I sit on a measly 61 hours of gameplay, so I am in no way an expert of this game. 

 What I CAN  tell you is that there are moments in that 61 hours of gameplay that I will probably never forget. This game makes you feel things you won't feel in any other shooter. Call of Duty thrives on high adrenaline, rapid paced combat. Battlefield slows it down a bit, but maintains a good balance of action and spacing between engagements. 

 Arma 3 is a completely different ballpark. There is a LOT of spacing between engagements, which adds massive suspense and makes every firefight very, very meaningful. When combat initiates, there is definately adrenaline pumping action, but it's not fast. Combat is very slow, almost methodical (just like real life) but very, very... awesome. Some things that you'll see in an Arma firefight that you will not see anywhere else:
 - Engagements will be very long distance, often hundreds of meters away, especially if you're roaming the hills or open wilderness. Enemies may only be a fleck in your scope, on another hill entirely, several football fields away from you.
 - You often won't know where you're getting shot from if you're taken by surprise. You don't get any indicators that say ""Hey! someone to your left just shot you!"". Instead, you'll be forced to take cover and locate the enemy the old fashioned way: watching and listening.
 - If you get shot, you probably wont have time to react. One or two shots will kill you without much warning.
 - Teamplay is CRUCIAL. Medics, Anti-Tank, Heavy Gunners all have a part to play in their teams success. 
 - Communication on a whole other level. There is a radio/audio system in the game that is essential to a squad's success. Squad leaders will be vocal, squadees must be willing to take orders and communicate with their superioirs. Directions will not be called out like ""LEFT! RIGHT!"" but rather with compass bearings such as ""There's at least 3 of them at... 248""
 - Stand/Crouch/Prone is also at another level entirely. You can also hunch over, stand up super tall, sit down, lean on your side, bend your body left and right etc.. Manipulating these stances and using them to show as little of you as possible may be a key factor on whether you live or die
 - Every move you make has a pro and a con attached to it. Fire your weapon? Might kill someone, but you might also give your position away or get shot as you peak out of cover. Forget to look left? Arma teaches that wherever you don't look, there will be something that kills you.
 - NO HITMARKERS. You have to make your own call as to whether or not the guy you just shot is dead. If you make the wrong call, your squad may advance only for one of them to be shot by a (very much alive) enemy solider
 - Tanks and armored vehicles are terrifying. It's not like Battlefield where a tank shows up, everybody continues their daily routines and hopefully somebody with anti tank weaponry deals with the 15 ton chunk of metal. Armored vehicles are terrifyingly powerful with weapons foot soldiers can only dream of. A whole squad of 20 people will immediately hit the deck if one of them shpws up, hoping that their AT guys can do the job because...
  - You don't respawn back into the heat of battle. You reaspawn in a base in the middle of nowhere and you either have to take a helicopter to meet with your squad, or ""HALO jump"", which teleports you to an exaxct location but 6000 feet up in the sky, forcing you to have to use your parachute to land safely. HALO jumping back into combat is suicide. Big shiny glorified baloons make really, really good target practice. That also means...
  - If you lose that aforementioned anti-tank guy, you're hooped unless someone takes the risk and picks the launcher off his dead body. That is, unless the tank/armored car blows him up before he gets there. Then 20 people are stranded with very little to do, which means...
 - Every life counts.

 The combat is unreal. I remember we had to clear this city of enemies, entirely. It took us upwards of an hour, but  we checked every single building, room by room, until, In the center plaza, there he stood; the last man we had to kill. All the other building were checked, and I saw a head poking out behind this obstacle in the dead center of the city,

 ""I found him!"" I yell over the squad's radio, ""Central Garden, straight north"" I notice he pokes his head around the corner. My assault rifle was depleted.

 I knew I should have packed more flipping ammo.
 
 So I pull out my pistol. Fire, miss, fire, miss, rinse andrepeat. I empty my whole clip and the man is not dead. So I reload, and just start Terminator walking my way towards this guy. Firing every round I have. The guy doesn't poke his head out anymore. One clip exhausted, then another. And another. This guy will not die. I least I'm supressing him. 

 Then he pops around, shoots me once. Dead.

 My squad catches up ""What the hell was all that shooting?!"" the commander expresses.
 
 They grenade him. Dead.

 Wish I'd have thought of that sooner. 

 The medic gives me a nice repair. I borrow some mags off of him. We get on the chopper, talking about how wicked that mission was. We get a new one, something about planting a bomb somewhere.

 At this point the squad has bonded. We knew eachothers names, at least. We just kept talking, getting closer to the LZ, mocking the pilot for driving too low to the ground. We land and immediately, the chopper comes under fire.

 ""RUN! SPREAD OUT!""

 The heli blows up before it can leave. We all die in a blaze of glory.

 And I left the game after that.

 I cannot recommend this game enough."
76561198176296555,107410,True,0.944918155670166016,"I spent several years in the army and I gotta say this game is spot on with the training and atmosphere the military provides. I love how difficult this game is, and I love all of the different features the game provides. It is NOT easy to hit a target with an assault rifle from 300 yards in real life, and this game seems to match that same difficulty. Fatigue is a real thing and it seriously hinders your accuracy in real life...Arma 3 makes you stop and catch your breath if you run too far or carry too much gear, or you will have a hard time hitting your target. Enemies are not stupid and they have great vision. I was engaged by two enemies from about 200 yards away and they were using bushes for cover as well as 3-5 second rushes when moving. The AI is more advanced than the average taliban are in real life. haha :p Given my love for the military and for videogames, this one is definitely one of my favorites of all time :D"
76561198130981093,107410,True,0.943312287330627441,"I'm not into arma anymore, but as you can probably tell from the amount of hours I've spent paying this game; I've had an incredible time.

Most of the hours clocked into this game have been spent on roleplay servers. They were so fun back in the day..people weren't too serious, and neither too silly. It was very balanced, very fun. Very replayable.

But arma ain't all about roleplay, so let's talk about other things:

I'll start with combat mechanics, obviously - as the game is all about fighting lol. 
The combat is ABSOLUTELY FLIPPING GREAT! You got things like bullet drop which keeps you on your game, and other things such as weapons becoming less effective as the bullet travels mid-air..you also have very aweosme-looking postures which you can adopt; from laying prone, to sitting on your bum, to crouching, leaning side-to-side, and all dat weird jazz.

It's also very realistic in that, you can only take 1-5 shots before you die pending on which weapon is used against you and what kind of protective gear you have equipped. This means that you have to be VERY careful in-game, otherwise you might just get shot in the head and die. Personally, I enjoy such hardcore mechanics.
Another hardcore mechanic is how damage taken is based on where you are hit on your body. So if you've been shot in the head, you're likely to take a hell of a lot of damage, and this is where armour becomes a huge importance; without armour, you are as vulnerable as a mouse surrounded by a horde of cats. I shouldn't even need to stress how much you need armour! You can go light, or heavy - your choice. The amount you wear does affect movement speed though, so do be careful of that. It also affects how badass you look; I generally like to go light so I look like a badass mofo who is totally capable of destroying anyone who crosses my path lol. Not only that, but your appearance can also affect how easily an enemy can spot you. So if you have a huge bag on your back, and lightly coloured clothes- you can be sure people will spot you with ease.

So yeah. Useful information there, I know. But I am most certainly not done! We have to talk about the tanks, and the awesome vehicles that can totally blow ur balls off!

In arma, there are about 20 different ground vehicles, all unique in both appearance and purpose. You have a few anti-vehicle tanks, a few anti-people tanks, and a few artillery and anti-air tanks. Personally, I love the artillery....they're like mini nukes lol. 

You also have APPACHI ATTACK HELICTOPERS! I mean who doesn't like that!? And some awesome looking submarines and attack planes..and boats :):)
AND CARS WITH MOUNTED TURRETS ON!

Yeah, long-story-short -- arma has tons of vehicles, all awesome in both appearance and nature. Very useful for committing mass-genocide on dem pesky capitalist NATO forces....mmmm, satisfactory

Also sorry for not listing their names. I no good wit dat :(:(

Arma also has lots of game modes to choose from, so you're not restricted to just playing one gamemode and getting bored after an hour. I believe I've already listed one already; roleplay. Others include but are not limited to(due to custom game modes etc); TDM, KOH, KTF, PLAYER VS AI(forgot the official classification, sorry), 5v5 COMPETITIVE MATCHES (like that csgo competitive game mode), custom zombie modes, and survival modes. There are also singleplayer game modes which you can host, such as Zeus or custom Addons which allow for various different gameplay experiences; which brings me to my next topic...

There are loads of mods available on the steam workshop! From halo mods, to Star Wars, to enhanced combat system and mechanic mods, xcom mods, and various others which add more vehicles, factions, armour/clothing, more ai, etc...

The settings menus are also vast and fleshed out in arma, so you can rest assured that you'll be able to configure almost anything you want. 
The game also doesn't require a very high-tier computer to function nominaly, so lag shouldn't really be a problem; especially if you tune down the graphics via the settings menus a bit.

This'll be the last topic within this review; multiplayer.
Multiplayer is obviously a huge part of the game, as I've briefly mentioned previously(with the game modes). This game is almost solely multiplayer-based, but singleplayer is a thing and can be fun, so don't feel restricted. This game being focused mainly on multiplayer is obviously good for playing with friends. You can have much fun playing with friends online in this game, much fun indeed. Lag can be a problem though, so make sure you have a decent internet connection and don't be disappointed if you can't play with a friend based half way across the world from you :) but personally I feel the devs have really improved connectibility over the passed years in terms of multiplayer. Id say it's currently at its peak.

Check this game out. It's relatively cheap for its value, so I advise such.

Apologies if I've missed some flavourful features or mechanics. I'll definitely be sure to edit this review if anyone comes in screaming at me about how I didn't include ""this and that and this and that and this and that"" lol.

We're on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back. I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing.

I run, my Autorifleman runs, my Medic runs. But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across.

Anybody seen Full Metal Jacket all the way through? Remember the sniper scene?

The marksman takes a round in the leg as we're running and goes down. He then takes two more in the chest. The kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here.
He screams as he's being shot. Crawling, drenched in his own blood.
""SARGE? YOU AIN'T LEAVING ME OUT HERE LIKE THIS, RIGHT? I-I WANNA GO WITH YOU GUYS! C'MON SARGE, H-HELP ME! C'MON! PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!""

     Now that I am at almost 730 hours played at the time of this review's initial publication I thought it was time for me to review my favorite game. This is not going to be a typical review where they say something along the lines of ""swam in the air, 79 out of 10 would be break laws of physics again,"" although that has happened to me and it was hilarious. This is going to be an in depth and honest review of Arma 3.

First though, here is some context.

      When Arma 3 first came out in 2013 I was so excited because I had been watching Arma 2 for so long and I was really hyped on the Arma 3 trailers, not that I actually had a good enough computer to play either one of them of course, so I waited until I finally did. I waited for 3 1/2 years watching YouTube videos and wishing that I could have Arma 3, It was sheer torment. All the cool things that people did just made the situation worse: every valiant last stand against zombies that saved the city, every stealth mission that crippled the enemy, and every close air support gun run that saved a convoy that was under threat just made me want Arma 3 more. So, when I finally had a computer that was good enough to play games on it one of the first games that I got was Arma 3.

       Arma 3 was nothing like I had expected it to be, it was better. An entire virtual sandbox for me to do anything I wanted, go anywhere I wanted, and play any way I wanted. It was not like a ""sophisticated Battlefield"" or a ""Call of Duty on steroids"" like I was expecting it to be, or how I was told it was. Arma 3 is just better. Those descriptions don't even remotely do the game justice. The modding support is astounding to say the least, like I said earlier, zombies. The maps are gorgeous, the weapons are wonderfully modeled, and you have a fully customizable character from the face, to the clothes, to the voice. Arma 3 is more than meets the eye, sure it‚Äôs beautiful, but it also has a great deal of depth behind that gorgeous high polygon count tree, and highly reflective water, and I love it to death for it.

       Arma 3 is in some ways the next logical step for somebody who is into the first person shooter genre, you probably don't know what they say about the game but here it is anyway. ""Children play Call of Duty, boys play Battlefield, men play Arma."" I feel like this statement is true, at least on some levels. The Arma series just feels mature to me, and much more refined than Call of Duty or Battlefield as well. They are not games where you can easily be a""Super Duper MACV Recon SOG SEAL Delta Force Green Beret CIA Operator,"" go ""gunz blazin,"" and kill ""all dem dudes over dere."" Although that sometimes works much to my own surprise and amusement. Arma 3 requires at least some modicum of strategy, or my personal favorite, a great big helping of luck to win, or even be good at in some cases, and I think that is good thing, Arma demands that people invest time into.

       Arma 3 has a large amount of multiplayer content that somebody can enjoy, you can play on a life server and rise through the ranks to become whoever you want to be, whether you want to be are a brutal crime lord, or the mayor of the town. The king of the hill servers bring a nice challenge to Arma 3 where you can fight in and against, in a perfect world, a well organized group of players who are trying very diligently to accomplish their objectives in Arma 3's virtual world. I loved Arma so much that I decided to found a unit which can be found here: join.crabsunion.com

The choice really is up to you on what you want to do in the game, and the built in mission maker with the option to add a ""Zeus"" for mission changes on the fly is always a great option. It is fun to play God for a while, and terrorize your friends.

       The singleplayer content of Arma 3 is quite good, I am very much enjoying the new ""Stepping Stone"" campaign, where NATO forces are trying to seize the picturesque island of Malden in an attempt to attain and maintain aerial dominance over the critically important Strait of Gibraltar.The ""Apex Protocol Campaign"" is very well made in my opinion with several missions that make you feel like you really are a ""Super Duper MACV Recon SOG SEAL Delta Force Green Beret CIA Operator."" Another great thing about the Apex Protocol campaign is that it gives you the option of playing it with friends if you so choose, something I wish the other campaigns did as well.

       Many people say that Arma 3 has a steep learning curve and I disagree. You pick up new things very quickly in Arma 3, or at least I do. Arma 3 just has so much to learn that many people think that it is a very difficult game to play when it is not. Almost every time I play Arma 3 I learn something new about the game or how to play it more effectively. It does not matter whether this is some knowledge about how to use Zeus or make mission more effectively, if it is some new tactic for clearing houses, or even if it is a technique on how to get more stable frame rate. Even with my amount of play time, and the amount of videos I have watched on Arma 3, I am still learning new things constantly. I believe that fact alone sets Arma 3 apart from other games.

       Arma 3 is a somewhat underappreciated treasure in the gaming world with endless content and unlimited scenarios to explore and it deserves more publicity than it is getting. I hope that this review was helpful to you and informative as well. Furthermore I hope that it didn‚Äôt bore you to death too much. Anyways, you have a great day now."

76561198057309553,107410,True,0.932174444198608398,"I have owned this game for a number of weeks now and I have been completely hooked. Great game for the more serious war gamer, not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from Call of Duty series which I consider more for the younger gamers anyway.

Arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games, similar to Battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using. You will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10-20 minutes in a single location (sometimes longer, I personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward.

You will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance.

You can not respawn as quickly as you can in CoD if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic.

The graphics are great, the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to.

I recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible (unless doing paintballing or airgunning), and if you do buy the game - I recommend completing the whole VR Tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the Campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game."

August 20th 2019. I was in a Squad of 7 men. I had the duty of a combat life saver. We had to fly oversea's on a Helicopter. I couldn't tell if my pilot was drunk or my dial up internet was making the helicopter do acrobatics but it was intense. About 5 minutes of flying we touch down safely, getting out as my ears immediately explode from my sound mod making the helicopter 5000x louder. It was awesome. We continue down the road for another 200m when a sniper from the treeline blows off one of my boys heads. We all scramble for cover behind the hill. My boy and I had to kill the MMG who were suppressing our men. We take a flank to the left in hopes of gunning this asshole down. Because the AI are fucking superman, me and my boy were immediately spotted and suppressed by sniper fire behind a rock. He gets hit in the chest which caused a velocity wound and other medical wounds. I sew him up like the god I am and we continue down the hill under all sorts of fire. I take a bullet to my arm and leg, making me as slow as a 60 year old asthmatic hippo with 3 legs. I stitch up my wounds and began limping to some more cover. I fix my leg somehow and im mobile again, pushing into the objective we were supposed to take an hour ago. Our NATO squad successfully raided the base. Only 2 men were killed and all CSAT have been eliminated.

Or so we thought.

The man on the radio sounds like his balls dropped off Mount Everest. He tells us CSAT reinforcements will be arriving shortly. I was unprepared with only 3 mags of ammunition and only a few medical bandages and morphine left. After a few minutes of respite, a shot is echoed from the hills and another firefight takes place again. These assholes now have armored cars with .50 guns on them. 4 of our men are killed within seconds. Thankfully i brought AT rockets with me and I take out the armored car. It explodes in a fiery mess, leaving that area scorched. My boy and I take cover behind a shitty jeep as more and more bullets fly over our heads. He gets hit in the chest 2 times and in the leg 3. I'm out of ammunition in both weapons and I am forced to drag him behind a tree. I take a hit to my chest and start to bleed out. Medical supplies are running thin. 

A few minutes passed and the CSAT have stopped firing. They probably thought we all died. I failed to medic my friend as his cold, dead body lay in the grass. I scavenge off my dead teammates for ammo, leaving my aim in the garbage due to the multiple wounds to the arms. Just when I thought all was over, a NATO chopper has came to evacuate me. I have a blood pressure of the exact definition of trash, my heart rate is 50 and my screen is black and white. I'm limping up a hill while taking multiple shots from the CSAT hiding in the thick brush. I am able to get into the chopper and escape as the last man in my squad to live. 

From that day on, I have diagnosed myself with PTSD. Only play if your balls are made of titanium."

76561198123083438,107410,True,0.926028549671173096,"For this review I'm going to open with a price breakdown, because at the end of the day when you're looking at getting a game you're trying to figure out whether or not it's worth it.

[h1]Price Breakdown[/h1]
Full price of the game and all DLC without deals or bundles $200.25

With my 4,000 hours of gameplay that equates to
 $0.0502375 an hour of playtime (Or about 5 cents)
 $1.2057 a day of playtime

Days between 1 August 2016 (When I bought it) and 12 March 2020 (date of this review)
That's 1,319 days or 31,656 hours
 $0.00632581501137225170583775587566‚Ä¨ an hour (or about half a cent)
 $0.15181956027293404094010614101592 a day (Or about 15 cents)


Arma is a near future military sandbox experience that gives players access to play how they want, whether they want to be infantry, tank operators, war journalists, helicopter pilots, jet pilots, boat captains, divers. Arma has something to suit any players wants.

[h1]Are the DLCs worth it?[/h1]
So when we're looking at value it is well worth it. I often run into people going on in lobbies about how Arma is always bringing out DLCs that cost way too much for what they are and that Bohemia is just a moneyhungering company, but when you break it down the level of detail they bring to the table and the time you spend on the content is unparalleled in terms of replayability. Aside from the singleplayer campaigns and the maps introduced in DLCs all of the content is actually free to use whether you own the DLC or not, the only downside is that if you do use something that you don't own the DLC for then a watermark will show up on the side of your screen for a few seconds every five to ten minutes or so.

It seems that in many peoples eyes the most cardinal sins are the Contact DLC and Laws of War DLC. But I only ever hear complaints about them from people that when I get into debates with them they say 'Oh, I forgot Arma had a singleplayer."" or ""Pfffft, no one plays the singleplayer."" But this last statement couldn't be more wrong. In fact in terms of parts of this game that shine, the singleplayer campaigns and missions are a big part of that.

[h1]Singleplayer[/h1]
The way the tutorial seemlessly blends into the story of the larger campaign, to the political turmoil you find yourself being embroiled in, to the intrigue of the moral dilemmas you find yourself asking at the end of the Laws of War campaign. These stories are memorable! If you ever dip your hands in the Zeus gamemode (the veritable Dungeons and Dragons of the Armaverse) you'll often find yourself recreating some of those memorable experiences for other players, such as the uneasy downtime and that suspenseful few moments before a major gunfight.

[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]
If singleplayer isn't your thing then the multiplayer will keep you coming back again and again, whether you want to have a PVP killfest in King of the Hill, a PVE mission based gamemode in Invade and Annex or Antistasi, the aforementioned Zeus gamemode, a roleplay experience in ArmaLife servers, or a hardcore military simulation. Arma has it all. When it comes to the multiplayer, most of my most enjoyable moments have been the downtime in between missions, whether chilling at the base or traveling to the area of operations. Arma multiplayer is a social experience at heart and that's where the multiplayer experience really shines in my eyes. I have met many people over the years that I am still good friends with to this day, and I have Arma to thank for that. We have had good times together and even better stories to tell. When I was first playing this game I didn't have a microphone so I had to type everything I wanted to get across, because of that I inadvertently learnt touch typing, which is pretty strange to say when someone asks you how you learnt to touch type. The official servers can become quite chaotic, but if you find a nice server a community is hosting then that can be like a second home, even with some of the chaotic people in the official servers the community as a whole is the most welcoming community I've come across in a game.

[h1]Community[/h1]
Touching on the community, Arma has a strong and committed modding and content creation community, mainly due to the passion of the users and the easy to use modding and mission creation tools, such as the 3DEN editor, a 3d mission maker contained within the game itself which harkens back to the golden age of Real Time Strategy games, such as Age of Empires. So if what you want to do isn't quite in the game, you're sure to find a mod or a mission that allows you to do that and if you can't there is an abundance of information on how to make it yourself. And with the easeability of sharing modlists, it's easy to bundle all of the mods you need to make the experience you want to play and then share the list with your mates so that you can all play together.

[h1]Is Arma The Game For You?[/h1]
All in all there is a lot of downtime in this game, so if you're all about instant gratification, killstreaks and being the best of the best then this game probably isn't for you. Arma is a team game and a lot of the game is spent walking, travelling or planning which gives you a lot of time to get to know your team. So if you're not into that then this might not be the game for you when it comes to the multiplayer. If you're looking for a game that is a million different games however, Arma is for you. Because every experience is different and with mods it can even be an entirely different game, for an example just look at DayZ or PlayersUnknownBattlegrounds which both started their lives as mods on Arma.

Arma 3, best 4,000 I've spent in a game ever."
76561198097852352,107410,True,0.925913095474243164,"After putting in over 3500 hours, I have seen the good, the bad, and the downright ugly that ARMA III has to offer. With that being said, I offer my review. It will be a bit long, but after this much time in game, there is a lot to discuss. 

First off, the campaign for single player is ok, but not great. You will be able to find other games with better campaign story modes than ARMA III as the main focus is put on the Multiplayer aspect. However, the campaign and story does prove challenging and the story is solid enough to keep you entertained and engaged. 

Secondly, The DLC content is hit or miss. 

GOOD DLC!
-Tanks add several new tanks into the game and make putting a AP round through your enemy a joy!
-Jets add several new jets to wreak havoc with! It also adds a aircraft carrier!
-Marksman adds some of the best sniper rifles in the game period! Also adds several ghillie suits and scopes. 

Decent DLC.
-Helicopters adds two helis to the game. Mostly for heavy lifting. 
-APEX adds an Island called Tanoa. A dozen weapons and gear. A few vehicles and a few VTOL aircraft. 

Bad DLC!
-Karts. Go-karts on a battlefield. Is this a joke?
-Laws of War. A single player mini campaign for a multiplayer focused game.  Not worth your money.
- Tac-Ops. Again, another single player mini campaign in a multiplayer focused game. Not worth your money.

Third on the list in multiplayer. The true fun to be had with ARMA III is through the multiplayer. There are 1000's of servers all with different options to chose from fitting nearly every type and style of game play. Zombies, they got it. Not into Zombies? No problem. Co-op, yep! Role play, check! Survival, you bet! PvP for those that like to kill others and PvE for the more casual crowd can be found.

Fourth. The community of players found in ARMA III are some of the best I have seen. They are often found to be helpful and willing to lend a hand to newer players and also to veterans in need of assistance. With that being said, you will however run into the occasional troublemaker, rule breaker, or very rarely a hacker. Most of them are dealt with swiftly by the server admins. Then, also,  there is those few players who have little time to read the server rules and blindly run off into the battlefield annoying players by doing things they shouldn't. When corrected by others, they will usually reply "" I didn't know the rules. "" A word of advice. When entering a server, read the rules or simply ask in chat and other players will usually be happy to explain them. 

Fifth, the graphics. For a game that is over 5 years old, the graphics are good. Not great mind you, but good to say the least. 

Sixth, the game play. ARMA III focuses on two things. Realistic militarised game play and multiplayer action via servers. Most of the servers run mods created by people like you and me. Some are about survival and will have you scrounging the map for supplies and gear. Some are about playing team death-match. Some are co-op missions. They can be very fun and can add a lot of vehicles, maps, gear, aircraft, weapons, scenarios, and more to the game. However, no one is prefect and you will find yourself dead periodically after simply opening a door, walking down stairs, entering a vehicle, exiting a vehicle, etc. The point is, expect the unexpected. While this does not happen all the time, you most definitely will encounter a few bugs and glitches from time to time. The most common and frustrating is the sudden vanishing of vehicles left at your base. ARMA loves to eat vehicles for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Also, it will eat your gear, weapons, base, and well....pretty much anything.  So don't get too attached to your stuff. As a server admin for several different servers, I have spent entire days replacing lost items. However, do not expect all admins to be as accommodating as losing items in ARMA is all part of the game.

In all, ARMA III can be a very fun game to play. It's strength comes from the almost limitless ways the game can be played on the 1000's of available servers. After all this time, I still find myself spending the weekends running missions on several servers. In the end, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes realistic military style games."

311 days ago i was Developer banned from Arma 3. The day before i received this ban i had decided to download arma after months away from it. I downloaded the game, it remembered all my mods, downloaded them then i fired the game up.

Do you lads feel out of sorts some times and you sit looking at you vast steam library wondering what to play. Its kinda like choosing a film on Netflix, before you know it times up and you cant be bothered. It was like that. I sat in the in game menu for one minute (screen shot to prove it) before deciding not to play. I exited the game, steam and shut down my PC. 

The following day i decided i was going to fully get back into it. I loaded up my computer. Steam automatically opened but this time with a message. You have been banned from the following games (ARMA 3).

It stated i was banned by the developer. I immediately thought why the hell was i banned. I contacted BI within ten minutes. The response was the same as it remains today. 'we do not deal with bans, battleye do. Please contact battleye if you need support with a ban.' 

BUT YOU DO DEAL WITH BANS - THIS IS A DEV BAN NOT A BE BAN????

I spent the last 10 months contacting BE who eventually responded to tell me that they did not ban me nor did they find anything on my PC that was suspicious to them at the time of my ban. They informed my my logs were 'spotless'

I swung my attention back around to BI. I contacted them the other day. A chap called Dominik responded saying the ban was a battleye ban not a DEV ban.  I have since sent him images of my ban stating it was a DEV ban, steams explanation of a DEV BAN which states a developer informs valve of an account that is suspicious and valve ban them. I have sent images of my conversation with BE and proof that in the two weeks before my ban i had one minute of game time which was spent in the menu. 

The emails have fallen of deaf ears.....No response from Dominik. 

I am absolutely heart broken that from the past 10 months i have been unable to play with my friends and it looks like this situation is not going to change. I am disgusted as the lack of acknowledgement and willingness to support and resolve this from BI. 

I have so many fond memories in Arma 2, OH & 3 but it looks like this is the end of the road for me. I will miss the random chats in game, the communities i was part of and the battles of the field. 

You never know, if you guys blow this up they might just let me back :)"

76561198061912275,107410,True,0.910561800003051758,"Arma 3 is like that long-term girlfriend/boyfriend you date where, at the honeymoon phase, you are smitten and are like ""wow, this is a 10/10 unique experience."" However, as the months turn to years and time rolls on, you start to realize there are shinier, prettier experiences out there- better looks, sexier moves, more stable, but you stick with it. You realize you're really with a solid 7/10, but **** is it fun. There are things he/she can do that no one else can, and well, despite deviations time to time to fantasize about other experiences, and several on-again/off-again times spent dabbling in those fantasies, you find yourself coming back to him/her. You find yourself truly happy...even after the worst (and unstable) times. Come to think of it, maybe this isn't a healthy relationship, but at the end of the day, it's a **** fun one.

Arma is an unstable, buggy ride and a bit overwhelming on first impressions, but it's an experience that you don't get in any other sandbox game or military shooter. The community is really what drives this game. It's a quasi-sim/quasi-arcade experience that can be tailored to the community/user's need given a little time spent learning how it all works. The developers do a decent job of providing documentation to understand how content creation and mission editing functions, and the community fills (and exceeds) the areas unfulfilled and self-imagined. There are few communities as diverse and robust as Arma's. In one night's events, you can go from playing a modern-day military sim night with your homies, to WWII, Vietnam, then Star Wars, Halo, Starship Troopers, Aliens, to the bloody revolutionary war and more. In short, Arma should be judged more as a sandbox & framework for community addons than a game on its own, and one that over the last 6 years developed into being highly accessible to the average user without even needing to touch a text editor or understand how it works to get custom games going through its implementation of a ""Dungeon Master"" style mission builder called ""Zeus."" Arma's experience varies greatly depending on your level of tolerance for troubleshooting and patience with searching/installing addons. 

This is best experienced by being dragged in by a community of friends... really it's kind of Stockholm Syndrome that kept me in it to start, and the incredible, fun, sometimes frustrating, and hilarious experiences made along the way is something no other game has offered and keeps me coming back. Give it a go, or watch some communities stream their experiences and see for yourself."

76561197979139992,107410,True,0.908434510231018066,"Well after playing this game for a few hours I thought it was about time to write a review.

I struggle to think of many games past or present that manage to do what Arma 3 does. Before the impending praise I'm about to give this game I will say 2 things. 

First, there will be bugs. Not the Starship Troopers kind... Well actually you can kill bugs as a Starship Trooper but I'm talking glitches, rubber banding, inventory issues, layer upon layer of mods causing compatibility issues and the list goes on. You simply have to embrace these problems and make them part of the enemy which you have to overcome! If you are easily put off by the above, Arma isnt for you, in fact the way games are pushed out these days a don't think many games would be for you.

Second, so far I have spent ¬£150 on this game (not including money spent on my own private server endeavours and donations to other public server communities) which sounds and is slightly ridiculous HOWEVER I have spent over 6000 hours on this game which is more than the rest of my steam library combined so as a time spent versus money paid its the cheapest game I've ever bought. All I say to anyone who somehow doesn't own it yet is wait for a Steam super sale and buy everything in one nice discount and your laughing!

The above remain the only 2 reasons I would not recommend this game, price Inc all dlc and the constant battle with bugs etc. All that aside Arma 3 is simply one of the best things you can buy for your PC. From the seemingly infinite Steam Workshop content to the fact that you can do anything from Milsim team based combat to simple PvP to cooperative missions to RPG style game modes to racing mods and a small off shoot you may have heard of called DayZ (Arma 2 mod but ya know what I'm getting at) it really does tick every box. There is a huge learning curve in the form of keybindings. It takes time just finding the right section to rebind keys but once you are comfortable I find the control of your character, chopper, jet, quad bike, humvee, tank, golf caddy etc quite intuitive. No other game gives you as many stances to be in. You can literally find a stance which gives you line of sight through a small hole in a wall at any angle. There are basic and advanced settings for flying so you can feel like a pro or take it easy with simplified physics and controls.

One final word... Community! As with all games you are bound to find trolls and people too competitive to remember what manners are, however on the whole Arma has a great community of players. I play 90% coop missions these days and it is just a breath of fresh air to be playing multiplayer on such a grand scale without this furious and frantic atmosphere which is so prominent in most multilayer games these days. After the demise of the Battlefield franchise after BC2 and BF3 I really needed a game to fill my need for military shooters and Arma 3 came to my rescue.

Rather than go on and on, all I will end on saying is that this game is more like a template for you to then decide what you actually want to spend your time doing. If you are on the fence, browse the workshop and see the sheer amount of 5 star community made content from overhaul mods to subtle quality of life mods. You could spend 6000 hours just playing all the single player campaigns made by other users."

Crowd around, children, it's story time.

One day, not so long ago, my squad had just destroyed an anti-air battery. Our pilot landed, and the rest of the squad boarded one by one. I was about to get in when the rockets started flying.

The chopper lifted off, with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes. Unwilling to die before then, I rushed to the nearest cover, a small house by a narrow road. I entered to find a ten year-old player who had also been left behind. He explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his ""clan"".

I politely declined, explaining that my own squad was inbound. As I finished, a Ghost Hawk flew over the horizon. My squad had arrived.

This noble child soldier and I were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting. The sniper screamed as a 6.5 mm cartridge entered his leg. His shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as I climbed in the transport.

My new friend was dead.

Grossly outdated graphics engine, poorly optimised, it remains the closest game you can ever play to the real thing. During its heyday, milsim communities and modders made this more of an experience than some simple combat simulator - I was able to don exactly the same equipment, uniform and loadouts that I served with while in the army.
NOT worth it if you're playing vanilla arma - terrifying and immersive if you use mods.
You can eat, climb walls, abseil, drink, splint fractures, dress burns, dig foxholes, engage in melee, interrogate, be suppressed and find yourself in a house being breached and cleared by the enemy.

The reason why this game is so hard to review lies in the sheer size of the game and the variety of things it may or may not offer for the player.

I take Arma 3 for what it is first and foremost: a platform. What you get is a good looking game with a solid (would be great, but you have to do some optimization to boost your performance) engine, two amazing maps (Stratis and Altis, which is probably the most impressive map I‚Äôve seen in any open world-ish game) and the prospect of near endless new content from the community.

What you don‚Äôt get is an easy to get into mil-shooter with CoD sized maps and a quick pace. If you‚Äôre in for uncomplicated, fast paced PvP gameplay, you should probably look elsewhere. If you‚Äôre sick of that, however, Arma 3 might be just your thing. 

The strength of the Arma series is freedom (**** yeah). You are free to mod the game into almost anything you want, create any type of mission and make your very own gameplay experience. You have to invest some time into the game, but once you got into it, the opportunities are endless.

Want to play huge adversial or coop maps with a hundred players or more?  Arma is just your thing and there are big communities (in many different languages) that will help you find that epic experience.

Want to play singe player? Well, if you expect strong single player content with interesting characters and storyline and so on, then Arma 3 isn‚Äôt the game you‚Äôre looking for.  Or is it? Right now Bohemia delivered one part of a three part campaign ‚Äì those missions are challenging, offer a solid variety of infantry gameplay but don‚Äôt expect a good story or interesting characters. But as mentioned before ‚Äì the huge amount of community made missions and mods offer hours and hours of playtime.

Personally I prefer small cooperative missions to play with friends. Already the steam workshop has countless missions for 2-5 players. 

So, should you buy Arma 3? Well, I‚Äôd certainly recommend it, if any of the things I mentioned above sounds fun to you. It is to say though, that this game is not something that everyone might like, so stay away from it if you are not willing to invest some time into it.

I hope that this review helped some people to decide whether or not they should by Arma 3. Please note that I‚Äôm not a native English speaker, so the language used in this review might seem a little odd for some."

Briefly, I remember that every single second I've played this game is my favorite memory. As I do so, the developer's splash screen flashes on the screen, followed by the warm  welcome of the ARMA III logo and subsequent main menu screen. In this moment, I feel happy and fulfilled. The events of the real world bear no importance to me as I undertake the task of deciding what I'm going to get myself into today. Shall it be Altis life antics? Do I recreate the Osama Bin Laden raid with my friends? Should I attempt to put myself into the shoes of a Marine in the middle of the Tet Offensive of late 1968? My mind wanders into the child-like curiosity and the uncertainty of the events that will take place tonight, and therefore I am excited. This is my conscious mind.

[b] Welcome to Arma 3: The Big One [/b]

If you didn't just start PC gaming an hour ago, you've probably heard of Arma 3. Every time someone says the names Call of Duty, Battlefield, Squad, Red Orchestra, Verdun, or any other shooter title out there, they do so in hushed tones and with their hands over their mouths for fear of the inevitable tongue-lashing they're about to receive from an Arma fan.
Fans of the Arma series are fiercly loyal and totally uncompromising. I have little doubt you've heard the following phrases:

[list]
[*]""If you want [i] realism, [/i] you should play Arma.""
[*]""Only casuals play. . . .""
[*]""Arma 3 is way better because . . . .  and  . . . . ""
[/list]

It's annoying and inarguably elitist but, in their defense, also mostly true. Arma 3 is not for someone who is looking for a casual shooter experience. Arma 3 is for those of us that want to camp out in the trees, waiting for the three guys you saw 30 minutes before, and hoping you can pull of a successful ambush quickly, quietly, and without getting hit. Then, walking for another 30 minutes to link up with another squad, grab some vehicles, and truck a few kilometers out to set up a new FOB. You can expect to go upwards of 3 hours without firing a shot on certain servers.

Which brings me to my next point. . . 

[b] The Game Within a Game Within a Game Within a Game. . . . [/b]

One of A3's major selling points is it's massive, active, dedicated, and diverse community of modders. Arma 3 has a great single player campaign and a few nice King of the Hill and Wasteland servers that you will want to visit occasionally, but Arma gets particularly interesting when you go mod shopping. 

in the mood to lose track of 30 hours while you're dodging police officers and rival gangs as you fight to expand your criminal empire across Altis and/or Tanoa?
Asylum 'Life' servers are a personal favorite of mine. Complete with a living, player-driven economy, impactful politics between gangs and a police force trying to keep control of the island as these gangs throw lead and shade at one another in a constant struggle for turf. If that sounds familiar to you, make no mistake, GTA V doesn't come close to touching the complexity of Life servers.

There are mods for different eras of warfare, gamemodes for about anything you can imagine, and you can find most of them on Steam Workshop, making it easy to access and giving you infinite playtime. You literally cannot run out of things to do because there is [i] always [/i] more content.

I could honestly write about Arma all evening but I'll leave you with a few pros and cons and then I'll wrap things up for you.

[b] PROS: [/b]
[list]
[*]Infinite play value, you can never run out of content
[*]satisfying and memorable moments come to those with patience
[*]game modes for almost everything thanks to the modding community
[*]great graphics for excellent immersion
[*]Endless selection of weapons, vehicles, gear, etc.
[*]Shed your 'casual' title and pick up the mark of 'master' gamer
[/list]

[b] CONS: [/b]
[list]
[*]Arma 3 is not well optimized and is very CPU intensive. Still perfectly playable at 30fps though you will need a high end i7 if you expect to get anywhere near 60fps on most multiplayer servers. AMD users be warned.
[*]Seriously not for casual gamers. I cannot stress this enough. It can take hours to accomplish simple goals depending on your game mode. Highly satisfying when things come together, though.
[*]Expect to move slowly while learning controls. Arma 3 is a game that uses just about [i] all [/i] of your keyboard and it will take you a while to master.

[b] But Should I Buy It? [/b]

I can't recommend this game enough. But if you're a die-hard Call of Duty fan but you still pick up this title, you're in for a rude awakening. Casual gamers be warned."
76561198072447858,107410,True,0.889115750789642334,"What did you do today? I did walk into a stopsign and died in Arma 3.
Meh.. After 3099 hours and 15000 deaths later it's still a game you will return back to.
Thumbsup all the way."
76561198026803446,107410,True,0.888425886631011963,Just buy it. Look at how many hours I have in this game. It's the best money you'll ever spend. It is all things to all gamers.
76561197995591955,107410,True,0.88792949914932251,"Can't tell you if you should buy it or not, but I can tell you this.
You will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isn't there and lack of content if you're not satisfied with what you have. 
But when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, it's something magical you just can't find in any other game.

Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly.
Arma is a game which you can never called finished. There will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations. 

Hope I expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :)

If you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem!

I'll give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, I've used hundreds of hours on Arma 3 that I would never take back.

Now, some people don't care much for the realism, and prefer action-movie esque shooters. That's fine. However, this game shines at gritty realistic firefights.

I have to admit, if you decide to start getting in depth with this game, it will be hard to stop depenending in which gamemode you play on. Life servers =Your done. Once you start progressing from rank to rank you'd never want to stop. This game is amazing, but very addictive to the point where someone like me has 4k hours on it."
76561198049422365,107410,True,0.882125139236450195,"Being an avid ArmA 2 Wasteland/DayZ player back in the day (about 1.5 years ago), I relished the thought of a new ArmA coming out. ArmA 2 was practically uknown until it's popularity was increased by DayZ. I found it interesting to jump into a BI (Bohemia Interactive) title that already had a steady fan-base behind it. Having been about a year since I purchased this game (launch) and over 100 hours of solid gameplay I feel that I can finally write a review that encompasses many of the aspects I have experienced within this game. Now I know what you're thinking: ""$59.99?! This isn't even considered a triple A title! That's like... that's like the price of CoD: Ghosts!"" Now, don't be intimidated by this price, for I can say that off the bat this game is worth a lot more than $59.99. From a value perspective, I found the price to be very reasonable based on the game's content nowadays.

Basically, ArmA is a series of hardcore military simulation; constantly reflecting real-world conditions into a video game. In ArmA 2, I feel that this was it's drawback, for there were certain scenarios where it was realistic to a point of frustration (breaking your leg on a 2 foot fall. It's a game guys, relax). ArmA 3 has found a good balance between an FPS/3rd Person shooter game and realism, making it extremely enjoyable as both a simulator [i] and [/i] a game. I also found that ArmA 3 has very good support for newbies to the series and is able to really engage players into the fun. I imagine it is much easier to get into ArmA 3 than I did ArmA 2 (I can't judge, I'm not new to it). 

The engine is decently optimized and is far less clunkier than the ArmA 2 engine, however rocks are still (and I guess forever will be) broken. Perhaps the game is having difficulty conforming such free player movement with an un-even surface. 

Pro tip: NEVER WALK ON ROCKS UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.

The game also has a variety of content; although players coming over from 2 will notice that there are A LOT less guns. This is partly due to the customization of guns. Instead of having a separate gun for each gun variation (M4A1 HOLO, M4A1 CCO, M4A1) you have a base gun and you are able to add sights, lasers, silencers, flashlights, what have you. However, this is not a full excuse- I feel that there are still a lesser amount of overall GUNS to shoot. Perhaps Bohemia Interactive is trying to fine-tune each gun into the patches as opposed to adding a ton of mediocre weapons simply for variety's sake. What's also very surprisingly good in this game is the Nvidia PhysX that was incorporated. Seeing my transport truck's wheels constantly bumping up and down according to the land under me while I drive troops through the night is oh-so-satisfying as well as, well... realistic! The physics engine has been extremely improved and I quite like it.

I'd like to finally talk about how the guns shoot and how they sound, for this is after all, a big part of the game. Once again I will compare it to ArmA 2, in saying clearly that ArmA 2 featured a more high-pitched ""tappy"" sound when you shot with vertical recoil, while 3 brings a much more deeper, louder shot as well as echo to accompany it as the gun travels backwards into your viewmodel as opposed to upwards. The guns definitely feel better for me, but in the end I'd like to classify this judgment as personal preference.

Lastly, the gamemodes of ArmA 3 are diverse and excellent, my favourite being Wasteland script. I won't go into detail here. There is also King of Hill, DayZ (OF COURSE, but it's MEH) and of course standard operations. Altis Life is also a really sweet one! Check those out if you end up buying.

So yeah, I really like this game and I think that there is so much potential for a growing community. Grab some buddies, hop into Stratis and keep overwatch with some snipers and riflers as you and your team move in through the bushes to grab an objective for more supplies for your squad! Really great game, I'd definitely recommend to any FPS/MILSIM fan! :D"

76561197963644421,107410,True,0.881744086742401123,"If you're coming to Arma 3 as an Arma series veteran, you already know what to expect. For the most part, the game hasn't changed since the last installment, but then it's always felt a little bit like Bohemia Interactive are still building on the groundwork laid back in 2001 by Operation Flashpoint, in the world's longest ever game of 'development Buckaroo'. Thankfully, the whole thing has yet to fall to pieces in any significant manner; it's quite happy to continue wobbling uneasily for now.

Arma has a reputation. It's known to be frighteningly obtuse, bewilderingly complex, and often hilariously broken. I can tell you right now that Arma 3 is no different, and absolutely still deserves that reputation. Thankfully, I don't think it's unfair to say that this is the closest an Arma game has come to being 'user friendly'. The controls have been tweaked, and the interface refined a little to accommodate more modern tastes. For these improvements alone, I do recommend it to newcomers to the series over any previous entry.
Coming from any other modern FPS game, it will still take a good few hours of what can feel an awful lot like hard work to get to grips with the controls, but I honestly think Arma 3 will see a far lower 'drop-out rate' of newbies who were frustrated to the point of giving up by the previous games.

At the time of writing, the elephant in the room is the lack of content available. When compared to Arma 2 (which is handsomely bolstered by an array of official expansion packs), the amount of hardware available to play with is frustratingly slim. In many cases, opposing armies are equipped with identical vehicles which get a slightly different paint job at best. For anyone used to the myriad of variants and oddments available in Arma 2, Arma 3 can feel awfully disappointing.
Fortunately, this is alleviated to some extent by the strong mod community. It has long been the case that the best parts of the Arma games are the parts not developed by Bohemia Interactive themselves, and Arma 3 is most definitely continuing this 'tradition'. Nevertheless, I can't help but feel that the game could've done with a few months more time in the oven before full public release.

Speaking of the mod community, I think it's criminal that almost none of the best, near-indispensible mods from Arma 2 have been officially integrated. For a self-professed 'war simulator', Arma 3 is hugely lacking in basic features like being able to rest your weapon on surfaces (even with a visible bipod), or tow damaged vehicles.

For all its flaws, though, Arma 3 is still a blast to play. If you can find a decent group of like-minded gamers with access to a voice-over-net server, you're in for some of the best gaming you'll ever experience. Sure, you'll probably have to load up on mods to satisfy your need for variety. And sure, sometimes the game will crash spectacularly, or the physics engine will flip out and kill you for standing too close to a wall. But when you're standing on a hilltop, looking out over an enemy outpost with your squadmates while a CAS helicopter strafes an enemy APC and spots targets for a distant sniper team; when everything clicks together in the way that only Arma can manage, you'll be glad to have been along for the ride."

76561198019977288,107410,True,0.875654399394989014,"I don't know where to start with this but let's just try:

My first experience with ArmA was with the Operation Flashpoint Series and later on with ArmA 1 (Cold war Assault) and then ArmA 2 (+ all possible Add-Ons).
And i just have to say, that i freakin fell in love with this game (ArmA3) from the very begining.

Sure there were heaves of problems, bugs and shit going wrong at the beginning but i still bought this game as soon as it was availabe (Which should've been like early Alpha or so).

But to explain why i sank over propably 2000 hours of my life into this game:

-Versatility: With the workshop added and all the mod support the game offers, it's just incredible for how long you are able to find new stuff. New Maps, weapons, uniforms, AI-Units, vehicles, helicopers, tanks, etc. etc.

-Versitility: With the ZEUS Modul and the Ed3n Editor you are able to creato soooooo much stuff. You can create YOUR OWN scenarios, and the overview them and change them while playing with zeus. if you play with a few people and you keep changing the missio maker you never ever ever run out of ideas/scenarios to play.

-Versitilititititiy: I think we've bee here before... With the huge mod support theres other beefits aswell. If you are playing onlie you will be able to find all sorts of server. wether you like playing as a lone wolf and kill other players, play in a huge team vs. AI encampments/bases, or just get flipping rich with selling apples. there's something for everyone out there.

But i don't want to hail everythig into the sky here, so here's a few negatives, which imo you should kow before you buy this:

-This game is in NO regards something for people lookig for a run & gun game. It's a Mil Sim after all.
-With the milsim aspect comes the complication of finding key bindings for everything you want to be able to do. so be preapared to learn buttloads of them (Especially with TFAR and ace in play).
-The graphics may look BRILLIANT on a good rig but if you are on minimum specs prepare for some frame problems,
 especially on bigger servers (although i have to say BI optimized a lot with the last few updates)

But other then that i can really just recommend this game if you are into military shooters that own you huge piles of different stuff.

And since my ""N"" key is fucked, here are some Ns for you guys that made it this far: n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n
That should've made up for the missed ones.

76561198030752353,107410,True,0.973724424839019775,"Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that it‚Äôs developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But it‚Äôs even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. 

At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the game‚Äôs complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your ass depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. 

Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3‚Äôs two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as I‚Äôm stuck on one mission that I simply can‚Äôt seem to complete.)

However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves.

Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). I‚Äôm sure there are so many others that I haven‚Äôt even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game.

In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless.

It‚Äôs grown alongside me, and has created some of the most memorable moments I‚Äôve ever experienced in a videogame. It‚Äôs one of those games which, when it finally ‚Äòclicks‚Äô with you, never quite leaves you. You always find yourself going back to it. It‚Äôs not a game which necessarily empowers you like DOOM or Wolfenstein, but the pay-off from successfully pulling off that mission, that flank, that firing solution, that landing, even that single shot, is unparalleled. 

I‚Äôll always remember the moody fog of the APEX Protocol co-op missions as me and my friend crawled through the jungle, silently taking out patrols hunting for us with flashlights dancing in the dark. I‚Äôll always remember finally Escaping from Tanoa after six hours with my mates ‚Äî it felt like a hiking trip by the end. I‚Äôll always remember staying prone in a ghillie suit as a whole platoon of Russians patrolled past my squad, just like in All Ghillied Up. No other game can recreate the thrill or complexity of these memories in an emergent and inherently personal manner. 

My friends and I, after ten years, have talked for hours about that one mission which went so wrong or that incredible shot one of us made across a whole valley, or just how much we associate some terrains like Sahrani or Stratis with our first years as teenagers back at school. ARMA, for me, is an experience equal in its thrills and frustrations as it is in its nostalgia ‚Äî you come to learn these towns, these fields, these roads and valleys and recall them each as affectionately as the other. Sure, things go wrong: a miscommunication is made, a helicopter crashes, the physics engine freaks out, or the server messes up, but most of the time, you‚Äôll laugh through it. 

ARMA is unlike any other game ‚Äî any other experience. I think this ramble has been quite open in displaying just how much it means to me, and how much it will continue to mean to me. I can assure you, if you give it a chance, it will quickly mean as much to you too."

+ Extremely mod friendly; enjoys full support from the Steam Workshop
+ Visuals & environmental design, save for a few issues here and there (i.e. empty buildings), has largely aged well & looks fantastic
+ Employs a deeply challenging level of realism
+ Multiplayer is still very active; boasts a wonderful variety of gameplay & modded servers to choose from
+ Long, content-packed single player campaign; player choices do affect potential endings, as there are several
+ Time control is back from Arma 2; player can speed up the passage of time, which helps SIGNIFICANTLY to combat the monotony of walking/running very long distances between objectives
+ Enormous map/playable area
+ User-created scenarios & a very easy-to-use scenario creator
+ Boasts incredibly varied gameplay mechanics; from piloting/driving myriad vehicles & gunships, to underwater missions, & everything in-between
+ Map & squad mechanics are back; while they may feel clunky to use in a combat scenario, a little practice goes a long way & serves to open up a slew of options on the battlefield

- Sound design is very hit & miss; some weapons sound identical to others, & vehicle sound effects tend to sound strangely muted
- Dialogue is also hit & miss; while I found the voice-acting to be done largely well, some of the dialogue is a bit awful
- Soundtrack often felt cheesy or inappropriate
- Mission pacing often feels very uneven; I felt that it often leaned too far into the realm of the tedious in the interest of realism (shouldn't be a bad thing in theory, but for the pruposes of a video game, it can put players to sleep in some missions)
- The initial learning curve is considerable, & the tutorial felt inadequate overall; mechanics are amazing on paper, but take an inordinate amount of time to master

Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality. There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release.

One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s.

As we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon. We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols. Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower.

There I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower. I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position. But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed.

As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive.

Falling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command. I had done it. I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive.

76561198007471493,107410,True,0.94609987735748291,"Where do I start with Arma 3...

 1st of all, have I played enough of this game? No, not in the slightest. My total playtime (see above) is pathetic in comparison to those around me. I see upwards of 2000, 3000, 4000 hours just looking at the reviews currently. At the time of writing this review, I sit on a measly 61 hours of gameplay, so I am in no way an expert of this game. 

 What I CAN  tell you is that there are moments in that 61 hours of gameplay that I will probably never forget. This game makes you feel things you won't feel in any other shooter. Call of Duty thrives on high adrenaline, rapid paced combat. Battlefield slows it down a bit, but maintains a good balance of action and spacing between engagements. 

 Arma 3 is a completely different ballpark. There is a LOT of spacing between engagements, which adds massive suspense and makes every firefight very, very meaningful. When combat initiates, there is definately adrenaline pumping action, but it's not fast. Combat is very slow, almost methodical (just like real life) but very, very... awesome. Some things that you'll see in an Arma firefight that you will not see anywhere else:
 - Engagements will be very long distance, often hundreds of meters away, especially if you're roaming the hills or open wilderness. Enemies may only be a fleck in your scope, on another hill entirely, several football fields away from you.
 - You often won't know where you're getting shot from if you're taken by surprise. You don't get any indicators that say ""Hey! someone to your left just shot you!"". Instead, you'll be forced to take cover and locate the enemy the old fashioned way: watching and listening.
 - If you get shot, you probably wont have time to react. One or two shots will kill you without much warning.
 - Teamplay is CRUCIAL. Medics, Anti-Tank, Heavy Gunners all have a part to play in their teams success. 
 - Communication on a whole other level. There is a radio/audio system in the game that is essential to a squad's success. Squad leaders will be vocal, squadees must be willing to take orders and communicate with their superioirs. Directions will not be called out like ""LEFT! RIGHT!"" but rather with compass bearings such as ""There's at least 3 of them at... 248""
 - Stand/Crouch/Prone is also at another level entirely. You can also hunch over, stand up super tall, sit down, lean on your side, bend your body left and right etc.. Manipulating these stances and using them to show as little of you as possible may be a key factor on whether you live or die
 - Every move you make has a pro and a con attached to it. Fire your weapon? Might kill someone, but you might also give your position away or get shot as you peak out of cover. Forget to look left? Arma teaches that wherever you don't look, there will be something that kills you.
 - NO HITMARKERS. You have to make your own call as to whether or not the guy you just shot is dead. If you make the wrong call, your squad may advance only for one of them to be shot by a (very much alive) enemy solider
 - Tanks and armored vehicles are terrifying. It's not like Battlefield where a tank shows up, everybody continues their daily routines and hopefully somebody with anti tank weaponry deals with the 15 ton chunk of metal. Armored vehicles are terrifyingly powerful with weapons foot soldiers can only dream of. A whole squad of 20 people will immediately hit the deck if one of them shpws up, hoping that their AT guys can do the job because...
  - You don't respawn back into the heat of battle. You reaspawn in a base in the middle of nowhere and you either have to take a helicopter to meet with your squad, or ""HALO jump"", which teleports you to an exaxct location but 6000 feet up in the sky, forcing you to have to use your parachute to land safely. HALO jumping back into combat is suicide. Big shiny glorified baloons make really, really good target practice. That also means...
  - If you lose that aforementioned anti-tank guy, you're hooped unless someone takes the risk and picks the launcher off his dead body. That is, unless the tank/armored car blows him up before he gets there. Then 20 people are stranded with very little to do, which means...
 - Every life counts.

 The combat is unreal. I remember we had to clear this city of enemies, entirely. It took us upwards of an hour, but  we checked every single building, room by room, until, In the center plaza, there he stood; the last man we had to kill. All the other building were checked, and I saw a head poking out behind this obstacle in the dead center of the city,

 ""I found him!"" I yell over the squad's radio, ""Central Garden, straight north"" I notice he pokes his head around the corner. My assault rifle was depleted.

 I knew I should have packed more flipping ammo.
 
 So I pull out my pistol. Fire, miss, fire, miss, rinse andrepeat. I empty my whole clip and the man is not dead. So I reload, and just start Terminator walking my way towards this guy. Firing every round I have. The guy doesn't poke his head out anymore. One clip exhausted, then another. And another. This guy will not die. I least I'm supressing him. 

 Then he pops around, shoots me once. Dead.

 My squad catches up ""What the hell was all that shooting?!"" the commander expresses.
 
 They grenade him. Dead.

 Wish I'd have thought of that sooner. 

 The medic gives me a nice repair. I borrow some mags off of him. We get on the chopper, talking about how wicked that mission was. We get a new one, something about planting a bomb somewhere.

 At this point the squad has bonded. We knew eachothers names, at least. We just kept talking, getting closer to the LZ, mocking the pilot for driving too low to the ground. We land and immediately, the chopper comes under fire.

 ""RUN! SPREAD OUT!""

 The heli blows up before it can leave. We all die in a blaze of glory.

 And I left the game after that.

 I cannot recommend this game enough."
76561198176296555,107410,True,0.944918155670166016,"I spent several years in the army and I gotta say this game is spot on with the training and atmosphere the military provides. I love how difficult this game is, and I love all of the different features the game provides. It is NOT easy to hit a target with an assault rifle from 300 yards in real life, and this game seems to match that same difficulty. Fatigue is a real thing and it seriously hinders your accuracy in real life...Arma 3 makes you stop and catch your breath if you run too far or carry too much gear, or you will have a hard time hitting your target. Enemies are not stupid and they have great vision. I was engaged by two enemies from about 200 yards away and they were using bushes for cover as well as 3-5 second rushes when moving. The AI is more advanced than the average taliban are in real life. haha :p Given my love for the military and for videogames, this one is definitely one of my favorites of all time :D"
76561198130981093,107410,True,0.943312287330627441,"I'm not into arma anymore, but as you can probably tell from the amount of hours I've spent paying this game; I've had an incredible time.

Most of the hours clocked into this game have been spent on roleplay servers. They were so fun back in the day..people weren't too serious, and neither too silly. It was very balanced, very fun. Very replayable.

But arma ain't all about roleplay, so let's talk about other things:

I'll start with combat mechanics, obviously - as the game is all about fighting lol. 
The combat is ABSOLUTELY FLIPPING GREAT! You got things like bullet drop which keeps you on your game, and other things such as weapons becoming less effective as the bullet travels mid-air..you also have very aweosme-looking postures which you can adopt; from laying prone, to sitting on your bum, to crouching, leaning side-to-side, and all dat weird jazz.

It's also very realistic in that, you can only take 1-5 shots before you die pending on which weapon is used against you and what kind of protective gear you have equipped. This means that you have to be VERY careful in-game, otherwise you might just get shot in the head and die. Personally, I enjoy such hardcore mechanics.
Another hardcore mechanic is how damage taken is based on where you are hit on your body. So if you've been shot in the head, you're likely to take a hell of a lot of damage, and this is where armour becomes a huge importance; without armour, you are as vulnerable as a mouse surrounded by a horde of cats. I shouldn't even need to stress how much you need armour! You can go light, or heavy - your choice. The amount you wear does affect movement speed though, so do be careful of that. It also affects how badass you look; I generally like to go light so I look like a badass mofo who is totally capable of destroying anyone who crosses my path lol. Not only that, but your appearance can also affect how easily an enemy can spot you. So if you have a huge bag on your back, and lightly coloured clothes- you can be sure people will spot you with ease.

So yeah. Useful information there, I know. But I am most certainly not done! We have to talk about the tanks, and the awesome vehicles that can totally blow ur balls off!

In arma, there are about 20 different ground vehicles, all unique in both appearance and purpose. You have a few anti-vehicle tanks, a few anti-people tanks, and a few artillery and anti-air tanks. Personally, I love the artillery....they're like mini nukes lol. 

You also have APPACHI ATTACK HELICTOPERS! I mean who doesn't like that!? And some awesome looking submarines and attack planes..and boats :):)
AND CARS WITH MOUNTED TURRETS ON!

Yeah, long-story-short -- arma has tons of vehicles, all awesome in both appearance and nature. Very useful for committing mass-genocide on dem pesky capitalist NATO forces....mmmm, satisfactory

Also sorry for not listing their names. I no good wit dat :(:(

Arma also has lots of game modes to choose from, so you're not restricted to just playing one gamemode and getting bored after an hour. I believe I've already listed one already; roleplay. Others include but are not limited to(due to custom game modes etc); TDM, KOH, KTF, PLAYER VS AI(forgot the official classification, sorry), 5v5 COMPETITIVE MATCHES (like that csgo competitive game mode), custom zombie modes, and survival modes. There are also singleplayer game modes which you can host, such as Zeus or custom Addons which allow for various different gameplay experiences; which brings me to my next topic...

There are loads of mods available on the steam workshop! From halo mods, to Star Wars, to enhanced combat system and mechanic mods, xcom mods, and various others which add more vehicles, factions, armour/clothing, more ai, etc...

The settings menus are also vast and fleshed out in arma, so you can rest assured that you'll be able to configure almost anything you want. 
The game also doesn't require a very high-tier computer to function nominaly, so lag shouldn't really be a problem; especially if you tune down the graphics via the settings menus a bit.

This'll be the last topic within this review; multiplayer.
Multiplayer is obviously a huge part of the game, as I've briefly mentioned previously(with the game modes). This game is almost solely multiplayer-based, but singleplayer is a thing and can be fun, so don't feel restricted. This game being focused mainly on multiplayer is obviously good for playing with friends. You can have much fun playing with friends online in this game, much fun indeed. Lag can be a problem though, so make sure you have a decent internet connection and don't be disappointed if you can't play with a friend based half way across the world from you :) but personally I feel the devs have really improved connectibility over the passed years in terms of multiplayer. Id say it's currently at its peak.

Check this game out. It's relatively cheap for its value, so I advise such.

Apologies if I've missed some flavourful features or mechanics. I'll definitely be sure to edit this review if anyone comes in screaming at me about how I didn't include ""this and that and this and that and this and that"" lol.

We're on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back. I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing.

I run, my Autorifleman runs, my Medic runs. But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across.

Anybody seen Full Metal Jacket all the way through? Remember the sniper scene?

The marksman takes a round in the leg as we're running and goes down. He then takes two more in the chest. The kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here.
He screams as he's being shot. Crawling, drenched in his own blood.

     Now that I am at almost 730 hours played at the time of this review's initial publication I thought it was time for me to review my favorite game. This is not going to be a typical review where they say something along the lines of ""swam in the air, 79 out of 10 would be break laws of physics again,"" although that has happened to me and it was hilarious. This is going to be an in depth and honest review of Arma 3.

First though, here is some context.

      When Arma 3 first came out in 2013 I was so excited because I had been watching Arma 2 for so long and I was really hyped on the Arma 3 trailers, not that I actually had a good enough computer to play either one of them of course, so I waited until I finally did. I waited for 3 1/2 years watching YouTube videos and wishing that I could have Arma 3, It was sheer torment. All the cool things that people did just made the situation worse: every valiant last stand against zombies that saved the city, every stealth mission that crippled the enemy, and every close air support gun run that saved a convoy that was under threat just made me want Arma 3 more. So, when I finally had a computer that was good enough to play games on it one of the first games that I got was Arma 3.

       Arma 3 was nothing like I had expected it to be, it was better. An entire virtual sandbox for me to do anything I wanted, go anywhere I wanted, and play any way I wanted. It was not like a ""sophisticated Battlefield"" or a ""Call of Duty on steroids"" like I was expecting it to be, or how I was told it was. Arma 3 is just better. Those descriptions don't even remotely do the game justice. The modding support is astounding to say the least, like I said earlier, zombies. The maps are gorgeous, the weapons are wonderfully modeled, and you have a fully customizable character from the face, to the clothes, to the voice. Arma 3 is more than meets the eye, sure it‚Äôs beautiful, but it also has a great deal of depth behind that gorgeous high polygon count tree, and highly reflective water, and I love it to death for it.

       Arma 3 is in some ways the next logical step for somebody who is into the first person shooter genre, you probably don't know what they say about the game but here it is anyway. ""Children play Call of Duty, boys play Battlefield, men play Arma."" I feel like this statement is true, at least on some levels. The Arma series just feels mature to me, and much more refined than Call of Duty or Battlefield as well. They are not games where you can easily be a""Super Duper MACV Recon SOG SEAL Delta Force Green Beret CIA Operator,"" go ""gunz blazin,"" and kill ""all dem dudes over dere."" Although that sometimes works much to my own surprise and amusement. Arma 3 requires at least some modicum of strategy, or my personal favorite, a great big helping of luck to win, or even be good at in some cases, and I think that is good thing, Arma demands that people invest time into.

       Arma 3 has a large amount of multiplayer content that somebody can enjoy, you can play on a life server and rise through the ranks to become whoever you want to be, whether you want to be are a brutal crime lord, or the mayor of the town. The king of the hill servers bring a nice challenge to Arma 3 where you can fight in and against, in a perfect world, a well organized group of players who are trying very diligently to accomplish their objectives in Arma 3's virtual world. I loved Arma so much that I decided to found a unit which can be found here: join.crabsunion.com

The choice really is up to you on what you want to do in the game, and the built in mission maker with the option to add a ""Zeus"" for mission changes on the fly is always a great option. It is fun to play God for a while, and terrorize your friends.

       The singleplayer content of Arma 3 is quite good, I am very much enjoying the new ""Stepping Stone"" campaign, where NATO forces are trying to seize the picturesque island of Malden in an attempt to attain and maintain aerial dominance over the critically important Strait of Gibraltar.The ""Apex Protocol Campaign"" is very well made in my opinion with several missions that make you feel like you really are a ""Super Duper MACV Recon SOG SEAL Delta Force Green Beret CIA Operator."" Another great thing about the Apex Protocol campaign is that it gives you the option of playing it with friends if you so choose, something I wish the other campaigns did as well.

       Many people say that Arma 3 has a steep learning curve and I disagree. You pick up new things very quickly in Arma 3, or at least I do. Arma 3 just has so much to learn that many people think that it is a very difficult game to play when it is not. Almost every time I play Arma 3 I learn something new about the game or how to play it more effectively. It does not matter whether this is some knowledge about how to use Zeus or make mission more effectively, if it is some new tactic for clearing houses, or even if it is a technique on how to get more stable frame rate. Even with my amount of play time, and the amount of videos I have watched on Arma 3, I am still learning new things constantly. I believe that fact alone sets Arma 3 apart from other games.

       Arma 3 is a somewhat underappreciated treasure in the gaming world with endless content and unlimited scenarios to explore and it deserves more publicity than it is getting. I hope that this review was helpful to you and informative as well. Furthermore I hope that it didn‚Äôt bore you to death too much. Anyways, you have a great day now."

Great game for the more serious war gamer, not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from Call of Duty series which I consider more for the younger gamers anyway.

Arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games, similar to Battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using. You will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10-20 minutes in a single location (sometimes longer, I personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward.

You will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance.

You can not respawn as quickly as you can in CoD if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic.

The graphics are great, the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to.

I recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible (unless doing paintballing or airgunning), and if you do buy the game - I recommend completing the whole VR Tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the Campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game."

August 20th 2019. I was in a Squad of 7 men. I had the duty of a combat life saver. We had to fly oversea's on a Helicopter. I couldn't tell if my pilot was drunk or my dial up internet was making the helicopter do acrobatics but it was intense. About 5 minutes of flying we touch down safely, getting out as my ears immediately explode from my sound mod making the helicopter 5000x louder. It was awesome. We continue down the road for another 200m when a sniper from the treeline blows off one of my boys heads. We all scramble for cover behind the hill. My boy and I had to kill the MMG who were suppressing our men. We take a flank to the left in hopes of gunning this asshole down. Because the AI are fucking superman, me and my boy were immediately spotted and suppressed by sniper fire behind a rock. He gets hit in the chest which caused a velocity wound and other medical wounds. I sew him up like the god I am and we continue down the hill under all sorts of fire. I take a bullet to my arm and leg, making me as slow as a 60 year old asthmatic hippo with 3 legs. I stitch up my wounds and began limping to some more cover. I fix my leg somehow and im mobile again, pushing into the objective we were supposed to take an hour ago. Our NATO squad successfully raided the base. Only 2 men were killed and all CSAT have been eliminated.

Or so we thought.

The man on the radio sounds like his balls dropped off Mount Everest. He tells us CSAT reinforcements will be arriving shortly. I was unprepared with only 3 mags of ammunition and only a few medical bandages and morphine left. After a few minutes of respite, a shot is echoed from the hills and another firefight takes place again. These assholes now have armored cars with .50 guns on them. 4 of our men are killed within seconds. Thankfully i brought AT rockets with me and I take out the armored car. It explodes in a fiery mess, leaving that area scorched. My boy and I take cover behind a shitty jeep as more and more bullets fly over our heads. He gets hit in the chest 2 times and in the leg 3. I'm out of ammunition in both weapons and I am forced to drag him behind a tree. I take a hit to my chest and start to bleed out. Medical supplies are running thin. 

A few minutes passed and the CSAT have stopped firing. They probably thought we all died. I failed to medic my friend as his cold, dead body lay in the grass. I scavenge off my dead teammates for ammo, leaving my aim in the garbage due to the multiple wounds to the arms. Just when I thought all was over, a NATO chopper has came to evacuate me. I have a blood pressure of the exact definition of trash, my heart rate is 50 and my screen is black and white. I'm limping up a hill while taking multiple shots from the CSAT hiding in the thick brush. I am able to get into the chopper and escape as the last man in my squad to live. 

From that day on, I have diagnosed myself with PTSD. Only play if your balls are made of titanium."

[h1]Price Breakdown[/h1]
Full price of the game and all DLC without deals or bundles $200.25

With my 4,000 hours of gameplay that equates to
 $0.0502375 an hour of playtime (Or about 5 cents)

Arma is a near future military sandbox experience that gives players access to play how they want, whether they want to be infantry, tank operators, war journalists, helicopter pilots, jet pilots, boat captains, divers. Arma has something to suit any players wants.

[h1]Are the DLCs worth it?[/h1]
So when we're looking at value it is well worth it. I often run into people going on in lobbies about how Arma is always bringing out DLCs that cost way too much for what they are and that Bohemia is just a moneyhungering company, but when you break it down the level of detail they bring to the table and the time you spend on the content is unparalleled in terms of replayability. Aside from the singleplayer campaigns and the maps introduced in DLCs all of the content is actually free to use whether you own the DLC or not, the only downside is that if you do use something that you don't own the DLC for then a watermark will show up on the side of your screen for a few seconds every five to ten minutes or so.

It seems that in many peoples eyes the most cardinal sins are the Contact DLC and Laws of War DLC. But I only ever hear complaints about them from people that when I get into debates with them they say 'Oh, I forgot Arma had a singleplayer."" or ""Pfffft, no one plays the singleplayer."" But this last statement couldn't be more wrong. In fact in terms of parts of this game that shine, the singleplayer campaigns and missions are a big part of that.

[h1]Singleplayer[/h1]
The way the tutorial seemlessly blends into the story of the larger campaign, to the political turmoil you find yourself being embroiled in, to the intrigue of the moral dilemmas you find yourself asking at the end of the Laws of War campaign. These stories are memorable! If you ever dip your hands in the Zeus gamemode (the veritable Dungeons and Dragons of the Armaverse) you'll often find yourself recreating some of those memorable experiences for other players, such as the uneasy downtime and that suspenseful few moments before a major gunfight.

[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]
If singleplayer isn't your thing then the multiplayer will keep you coming back again and again, whether you want to have a PVP killfest in King of the Hill, a PVE mission based gamemode in Invade and Annex or Antistasi, the aforementioned Zeus gamemode, a roleplay experience in ArmaLife servers, or a hardcore military simulation. Arma has it all. When it comes to the multiplayer, most of my most enjoyable moments have been the downtime in between missions, whether chilling at the base or traveling to the area of operations. Arma multiplayer is a social experience at heart and that's where the multiplayer experience really shines in my eyes. I have met many people over the years that I am still good friends with to this day, and I have Arma to thank for that. We have had good times together and even better stories to tell. When I was first playing this game I didn't have a microphone so I had to type everything I wanted to get across, because of that I inadvertently learnt touch typing, which is pretty strange to say when someone asks you how you learnt to touch type. The official servers can become quite chaotic, but if you find a nice server a community is hosting then that can be like a second home, even with some of the chaotic people in the official servers the community as a whole is the most welcoming community I've come across in a game.

[h1]Community[/h1]
Touching on the community, Arma has a strong and committed modding and content creation community, mainly due to the passion of the users and the easy to use modding and mission creation tools, such as the 3DEN editor, a 3d mission maker contained within the game itself which harkens back to the golden age of Real Time Strategy games, such as Age of Empires. So if what you want to do isn't quite in the game, you're sure to find a mod or a mission that allows you to do that and if you can't there is an abundance of information on how to make it yourself. And with the easeability of sharing modlists, it's easy to bundle all of the mods you need to make the experience you want to play and then share the list with your mates so that you can all play together.

[h1]Is Arma The Game For You?[/h1]
All in all there is a lot of downtime in this game, so if you're all about instant gratification, killstreaks and being the best of the best then this game probably isn't for you. Arma is a team game and a lot of the game is spent walking, travelling or planning which gives you a lot of time to get to know your team. So if you're not into that then this might not be the game for you when it comes to the multiplayer. If you're looking for a game that is a million different games however, Arma is for you. Because every experience is different and with mods it can even be an entirely different game, for an example just look at DayZ or PlayersUnknownBattlegrounds which both started their lives as mods on Arma.

Arma 3, best 4,000 I've spent in a game ever."
76561198097852352,107410,True,0.925913095474243164,"After putting in over 3500 hours, I have seen the good, the bad, and the downright ugly that ARMA III has to offer. With that being said, I offer my review. It will be a bit long, but after this much time in game, there is a lot to discuss. 

First off, the campaign for single player is ok, but not great. You will be able to find other games with better campaign story modes than ARMA III as the main focus is put on the Multiplayer aspect. However, the campaign and story does prove challenging and the story is solid enough to keep you entertained and engaged. 

Secondly, The DLC content is hit or miss. 

GOOD DLC!
-Tanks add several new tanks into the game and make putting a AP round through your enemy a joy!
-Jets add several new jets to wreak havoc with! It also adds a aircraft carrier!
-Marksman adds some of the best sniper rifles in the game period! Also adds several ghillie suits and scopes. 

Decent DLC.
-Helicopters adds two helis to the game. Mostly for heavy lifting. 
-APEX adds an Island called Tanoa. A dozen weapons and gear. A few vehicles and a few VTOL aircraft. 

Bad DLC!
-Karts. Go-karts on a battlefield. Is this a joke?
-Laws of War. A single player mini campaign for a multiplayer focused game.  Not worth your money.
- Tac-Ops. Again, another single player mini campaign in a multiplayer focused game. Not worth your money.

Third on the list in multiplayer. The true fun to be had with ARMA III is through the multiplayer. There are 1000's of servers all with different options to chose from fitting nearly every type and style of game play. Zombies, they got it. Not into Zombies? No problem. Co-op, yep! Role play, check! Survival, you bet! PvP for those that like to kill others and PvE for the more casual crowd can be found.

Fourth. The community of players found in ARMA III are some of the best I have seen. They are often found to be helpful and willing to lend a hand to newer players and also to veterans in need of assistance. With that being said, you will however run into the occasional troublemaker, rule breaker, or very rarely a hacker. Most of them are dealt with swiftly by the server admins. Then, also,  there is those few players who have little time to read the server rules and blindly run off into the battlefield annoying players by doing things they shouldn't. When corrected by others, they will usually reply "" I didn't know the rules. "" A word of advice. When entering a server, read the rules or simply ask in chat and other players will usually be happy to explain them. 

Fifth, the graphics. For a game that is over 5 years old, the graphics are good. Not great mind you, but good to say the least. 

Sixth, the game play. ARMA III focuses on two things. Realistic militarised game play and multiplayer action via servers. Most of the servers run mods created by people like you and me. Some are about survival and will have you scrounging the map for supplies and gear. Some are about playing team death-match. Some are co-op missions. They can be very fun and can add a lot of vehicles, maps, gear, aircraft, weapons, scenarios, and more to the game. However, no one is prefect and you will find yourself dead periodically after simply opening a door, walking down stairs, entering a vehicle, exiting a vehicle, etc. The point is, expect the unexpected. While this does not happen all the time, you most definitely will encounter a few bugs and glitches from time to time. The most common and frustrating is the sudden vanishing of vehicles left at your base. ARMA loves to eat vehicles for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Also, it will eat your gear, weapons, base, and well....pretty much anything.  So don't get too attached to your stuff. As a server admin for several different servers, I have spent entire days replacing lost items. However, do not expect all admins to be as accommodating as losing items in ARMA is all part of the game.

In all, ARMA III can be a very fun game to play. It's strength comes from the almost limitless ways the game can be played on the 1000's of available servers. After all this time, I still find myself spending the weekends running missions on several servers. In the end, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes realistic military style games."

76561198019130249,107410,False,0.92248910665512085,"Right before i get started - I was a massive fan of the Arma series and have been for 10+ years, it is the reason i bought my first gaming PC.

311 days ago i was Developer banned from Arma 3. The day before i received this ban i had decided to download arma after months away from it. I downloaded the game, it remembered all my mods, downloaded them then i fired the game up.

Do you lads feel out of sorts some times and you sit looking at you vast steam library wondering what to play. Its kinda like choosing a film on Netflix, before you know it times up and you cant be bothered. It was like that. I sat in the in game menu for one minute (screen shot to prove it) before deciding not to play. I exited the game, steam and shut down my PC. 

The following day i decided i was going to fully get back into it. I loaded up my computer. Steam automatically opened but this time with a message. You have been banned from the following games (ARMA 3).

It stated i was banned by the developer. I immediately thought why the hell was i banned. I contacted BI within ten minutes. The response was the same as it remains today. 'we do not deal with bans, battleye do. Please contact battleye if you need support with a ban.' 

BUT YOU DO DEAL WITH BANS - THIS IS A DEV BAN NOT A BE BAN????

I spent the last 10 months contacting BE who eventually responded to tell me that they did not ban me nor did they find anything on my PC that was suspicious to them at the time of my ban. They informed my my logs were 'spotless'

I swung my attention back around to BI. I contacted them the other day. A chap called Dominik responded saying the ban was a battleye ban not a DEV ban.  I have since sent him images of my ban stating it was a DEV ban, steams explanation of a DEV BAN which states a developer informs valve of an account that is suspicious and valve ban them. I have sent images of my conversation with BE and proof that in the two weeks before my ban i had one minute of game time which was spent in the menu. 

The emails have fallen of deaf ears.....No response from Dominik. 

I am absolutely heart broken that from the past 10 months i have been unable to play with my friends and it looks like this situation is not going to change. I am disgusted as the lack of acknowledgement and willingness to support and resolve this from BI. 

I have so many fond memories in Arma 2, OH & 3 but it looks like this is the end of the road for me. I will miss the random chats in game, the communities i was part of and the battles of the field.

76561198061912275,107410,True,0.910561800003051758,"Arma 3 is like that long-term girlfriend/boyfriend you date where, at the honeymoon phase, you are smitten and are like ""wow, this is a 10/10 unique experience."" However, as the months turn to years and time rolls on, you start to realize there are shinier, prettier experiences out there- better looks, sexier moves, more stable, but you stick with it. You realize you're really with a solid 7/10, but **** is it fun. There are things he/she can do that no one else can, and well, despite deviations time to time to fantasize about other experiences, and several on-again/off-again times spent dabbling in those fantasies, you find yourself coming back to him/her. You find yourself truly happy...even after the worst (and unstable) times. Come to think of it, maybe this isn't a healthy relationship, but at the end of the day, it's a **** fun one.

Arma is an unstable, buggy ride and a bit overwhelming on first impressions, but it's an experience that you don't get in any other sandbox game or military shooter. The community is really what drives this game. It's a quasi-sim/quasi-arcade experience that can be tailored to the community/user's need given a little time spent learning how it all works. The developers do a decent job of providing documentation to understand how content creation and mission editing functions, and the community fills (and exceeds) the areas unfulfilled and self-imagined. There are few communities as diverse and robust as Arma's. In one night's events, you can go from playing a modern-day military sim night with your homies, to WWII, Vietnam, then Star Wars, Halo, Starship Troopers, Aliens, to the bloody revolutionary war and more. In short, Arma should be judged more as a sandbox & framework for community addons than a game on its own, and one that over the last 6 years developed into being highly accessible to the average user without even needing to touch a text editor or understand how it works to get custom games going through its implementation of a ""Dungeon Master"" style mission builder called ""Zeus."" Arma's experience varies greatly depending on your level of tolerance for troubleshooting and patience with searching/installing addons. 

This is best experienced by being dragged in by a community of friends... really it's kind of Stockholm Syndrome that kept me in it to start, and the incredible, fun, sometimes frustrating, and hilarious experiences made along the way is something no other game has offered and keeps me coming back. Give it a go, or watch some communities stream their experiences and see for yourself."

76561197979139992,107410,True,0.908434510231018066,"Well after playing this game for a few hours I thought it was about time to write a review.

I struggle to think of many games past or present that manage to do what Arma 3 does. Before the impending praise I'm about to give this game I will say 2 things. 

First, there will be bugs. Not the Starship Troopers kind... Well actually you can kill bugs as a Starship Trooper but I'm talking glitches, rubber banding, inventory issues, layer upon layer of mods causing compatibility issues and the list goes on. You simply have to embrace these problems and make them part of the enemy which you have to overcome! If you are easily put off by the above, Arma isnt for you, in fact the way games are pushed out these days a don't think many games would be for you.

Second, so far I have spent ¬£150 on this game (not including money spent on my own private server endeavours and donations to other public server communities) which sounds and is slightly ridiculous HOWEVER I have spent over 6000 hours on this game which is more than the rest of my steam library combined so as a time spent versus money paid its the cheapest game I've ever bought. All I say to anyone who somehow doesn't own it yet is wait for a Steam super sale and buy everything in one nice discount and your laughing!

The above remain the only 2 reasons I would not recommend this game, price Inc all dlc and the constant battle with bugs etc. All that aside Arma 3 is simply one of the best things you can buy for your PC. From the seemingly infinite Steam Workshop content to the fact that you can do anything from Milsim team based combat to simple PvP to cooperative missions to RPG style game modes to racing mods and a small off shoot you may have heard of called DayZ (Arma 2 mod but ya know what I'm getting at) it really does tick every box. There is a huge learning curve in the form of keybindings. It takes time just finding the right section to rebind keys but once you are comfortable I find the control of your character, chopper, jet, quad bike, humvee, tank, golf caddy etc quite intuitive. No other game gives you as many stances to be in. You can literally find a stance which gives you line of sight through a small hole in a wall at any angle. There are basic and advanced settings for flying so you can feel like a pro or take it easy with simplified physics and controls.

One final word... Community! As with all games you are bound to find trolls and people too competitive to remember what manners are, however on the whole Arma has a great community of players. I play 90% coop missions these days and it is just a breath of fresh air to be playing multiplayer on such a grand scale without this furious and frantic atmosphere which is so prominent in most multilayer games these days. After the demise of the Battlefield franchise after BC2 and BF3 I really needed a game to fill my need for military shooters and Arma 3 came to my rescue.

Rather than go on and on, all I will end on saying is that this game is more like a template for you to then decide what you actually want to spend your time doing. If you are on the fence, browse the workshop and see the sheer amount of 5 star community made content from overhaul mods to subtle quality of life mods. You could spend 6000 hours just playing all the single player campaigns made by other users."

Crowd around, children, it's story time.

One day, not so long ago, my squad had just destroyed an anti-air battery. Our pilot landed, and the rest of the squad boarded one by one. I was about to get in when the rockets started flying.

The chopper lifted off, with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes. Unwilling to die before then, I rushed to the nearest cover, a small house by a narrow road. I entered to find a ten year-old player who had also been left behind. He explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his ""clan"".

I politely declined, explaining that my own squad was inbound. As I finished, a Ghost Hawk flew over the horizon. My squad had arrived.

This noble child soldier and I were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting. The sniper screamed as a 6.5 mm cartridge entered his leg. His shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as I climbed in the transport.

My new friend was dead.

Grossly outdated graphics engine, poorly optimised, it remains the closest game you can ever play to the real thing. During its heyday, milsim communities and modders made this more of an experience than some simple combat simulator - I was able to don exactly the same equipment, uniform and loadouts that I served with while in the army.
NOT worth it if you're playing vanilla arma - terrifying and immersive if you use mods.
You can eat, climb walls, abseil, drink, splint fractures, dress burns, dig foxholes, engage in melee, interrogate, be suppressed and find yourself in a house being breached and cleared by the enemy.

76561197971414496,107410,True,0.896043360233306885,"Arma 3 is a tricky game to review, but here‚Äôs me trying it anyway.

The reason why this game is so hard to review lies in the sheer size of the game and the variety of things it may or may not offer for the player.

I take Arma 3 for what it is first and foremost: a platform. What you get is a good looking game with a solid (would be great, but you have to do some optimization to boost your performance) engine, two amazing maps (Stratis and Altis, which is probably the most impressive map I‚Äôve seen in any open world-ish game) and the prospect of near endless new content from the community.

What you don‚Äôt get is an easy to get into mil-shooter with CoD sized maps and a quick pace. If you‚Äôre in for uncomplicated, fast paced PvP gameplay, you should probably look elsewhere. If you‚Äôre sick of that, however, Arma 3 might be just your thing. 

The strength of the Arma series is freedom (**** yeah). You are free to mod the game into almost anything you want, create any type of mission and make your very own gameplay experience. You have to invest some time into the game, but once you got into it, the opportunities are endless.

Want to play huge adversial or coop maps with a hundred players or more?  Arma is just your thing and there are big communities (in many different languages) that will help you find that epic experience.

Want to play singe player? Well, if you expect strong single player content with interesting characters and storyline and so on, then Arma 3 isn‚Äôt the game you‚Äôre looking for.  Or is it? Right now Bohemia delivered one part of a three part campaign ‚Äì those missions are challenging, offer a solid variety of infantry gameplay but don‚Äôt expect a good story or interesting characters. But as mentioned before ‚Äì the huge amount of community made missions and mods offer hours and hours of playtime.

Personally I prefer small cooperative missions to play with friends. Already the steam workshop has countless missions for 2-5 players. 

So, should you buy Arma 3? Well, I‚Äôd certainly recommend it, if any of the things I mentioned above sounds fun to you. It is to say though, that this game is not something that everyone might like, so stay away from it if you are not willing to invest some time into it.

I hope that this review helped some people to decide whether or not they should by Arma 3. Please note that I‚Äôm not a native English speaker, so the language used in this review might seem a little odd for some."

Briefly, I remember that every single second I've played this game is my favorite memory. As I do so, the developer's splash screen flashes on the screen, followed by the warm  welcome of the ARMA III logo and subsequent main menu screen. In this moment, I feel happy and fulfilled. The events of the real world bear no importance to me as I undertake the task of deciding what I'm going to get myself into today. Shall it be Altis life antics? Do I recreate the Osama Bin Laden raid with my friends? Should I attempt to put myself into the shoes of a Marine in the middle of the Tet Offensive of late 1968? My mind wanders into the child-like curiosity and the uncertainty of the events that will take place tonight, and therefore I am excited. This is my conscious mind.

76561198061699977,107410,True,0.889143705368041992,"[h1] The Big A3 [/h1]

[b] Welcome to Arma 3: The Big One [/b]

If you didn't just start PC gaming an hour ago, you've probably heard of Arma 3. Every time someone says the names Call of Duty, Battlefield, Squad, Red Orchestra, Verdun, or any other shooter title out there, they do so in hushed tones and with their hands over their mouths for fear of the inevitable tongue-lashing they're about to receive from an Arma fan.
Fans of the Arma series are fiercly loyal and totally uncompromising. I have little doubt you've heard the following phrases:

[list]
[*]""If you want [i] realism, [/i] you should play Arma.""
[*]""Only casuals play. . . .""
[*]""Arma 3 is way better because . . . .  and  . . . . ""
[/list]

It's annoying and inarguably elitist but, in their defense, also mostly true. Arma 3 is not for someone who is looking for a casual shooter experience. Arma 3 is for those of us that want to camp out in the trees, waiting for the three guys you saw 30 minutes before, and hoping you can pull of a successful ambush quickly, quietly, and without getting hit. Then, walking for another 30 minutes to link up with another squad, grab some vehicles, and truck a few kilometers out to set up a new FOB. You can expect to go upwards of 3 hours without firing a shot on certain servers.

Which brings me to my next point. . . 

[b] The Game Within a Game Within a Game Within a Game. . . . [/b]

One of A3's major selling points is it's massive, active, dedicated, and diverse community of modders. Arma 3 has a great single player campaign and a few nice King of the Hill and Wasteland servers that you will want to visit occasionally, but Arma gets particularly interesting when you go mod shopping. 

in the mood to lose track of 30 hours while you're dodging police officers and rival gangs as you fight to expand your criminal empire across Altis and/or Tanoa?
Asylum 'Life' servers are a personal favorite of mine. Complete with a living, player-driven economy, impactful politics between gangs and a police force trying to keep control of the island as these gangs throw lead and shade at one another in a constant struggle for turf. If that sounds familiar to you, make no mistake, GTA V doesn't come close to touching the complexity of Life servers.

There are mods for different eras of warfare, gamemodes for about anything you can imagine, and you can find most of them on Steam Workshop, making it easy to access and giving you infinite playtime. You literally cannot run out of things to do because there is [i] always [/i] more content.

I could honestly write about Arma all evening but I'll leave you with a few pros and cons and then I'll wrap things up for you.

[b] PROS: [/b]
[list]
[*]Infinite play value, you can never run out of content
[*]satisfying and memorable moments come to those with patience
[*]game modes for almost everything thanks to the modding community
[*]great graphics for excellent immersion
[*]Endless selection of weapons, vehicles, gear, etc.
[*]Shed your 'casual' title and pick up the mark of 'master' gamer
[/list]

[b] CONS: [/b]
[list]
[*]Arma 3 is not well optimized and is very CPU intensive. Still perfectly playable at 30fps though you will need a high end i7 if you expect to get anywhere near 60fps on most multiplayer servers. AMD users be warned.
[*]Seriously not for casual gamers. I cannot stress this enough. It can take hours to accomplish simple goals depending on your game mode. Highly satisfying when things come together, though.
[*]Expect to move slowly while learning controls. Arma 3 is a game that uses just about [i] all [/i] of your keyboard and it will take you a while to master.

[b] But Should I Buy It? [/b]

I can't recommend this game enough. But if you're a die-hard Call of Duty fan but you still pick up this title, you're in for a rude awakening. Casual gamers be warned."
76561198072447858,107410,True,0.889115750789642334,"What did you do today? I did walk into a stopsign and died in Arma 3.
Meh.. After 3099 hours and 15000 deaths later it's still a game you will return back to.
Thumbsup all the way."
76561198026803446,107410,True,0.888425886631011963,Just buy it. Look at how many hours I have in this game. It's the best money you'll ever spend. It is all things to all gamers.
76561197995591955,107410,True,0.88792949914932251,"Can't tell you if you should buy it or not, but I can tell you this.
You will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isn't there and lack of content if you're not satisfied with what you have. 
But when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, it's something magical you just can't find in any other game.

Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly.
Arma is a game which you can never called finished. There will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations. 

Hope I expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :)

If you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem!

I'll give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, I've used hundreds of hours on Arma 3 that I would never take back.

That being said, there's a reason why so many players in the review section have 1000+ hours in spite of this. You will simply will not find a game like this anywhere else. 

Now, some people don't care much for the realism, and prefer action-movie esque shooters. That's fine. However, this game shines at gritty realistic firefights. There's nothing glorious about shouting contact reports into the radio, bounding cover to cover, and hoping the next round doesn't have your name on it, but when you're finally back on the bird with your buddies headed home, and you finally feel the sense of relief wash over you.

76561198229080732,107410,True,0.882169544696807861,"Had this game for over 2 years now, and over 4000 hours played.

I have to admit, if you decide to start getting in depth with this game, it will be hard to stop depenending in which gamemode you play on. Life servers =Your done. Once you start progressing from rank to rank you'd never want to stop. This game is amazing, but very addictive to the point where someone like me has 4k hours on it."
76561198049422365,107410,True,0.882125139236450195,"Being an avid ArmA 2 Wasteland/DayZ player back in the day (about 1.5 years ago), I relished the thought of a new ArmA coming out. ArmA 2 was practically uknown until it's popularity was increased by DayZ. I found it interesting to jump into a BI (Bohemia Interactive) title that already had a steady fan-base behind it. Having been about a year since I purchased this game (launch) and over 100 hours of solid gameplay I feel that I can finally write a review that encompasses many of the aspects I have experienced within this game. Now I know what you're thinking: ""$59.99?! This isn't even considered a triple A title! That's like... that's like the price of CoD: Ghosts!"" Now, don't be intimidated by this price, for I can say that off the bat this game is worth a lot more than $59.99. From a value perspective, I found the price to be very reasonable based on the game's content nowadays.

Basically, ArmA is a series of hardcore military simulation; constantly reflecting real-world conditions into a video game. In ArmA 2, I feel that this was it's drawback, for there were certain scenarios where it was realistic to a point of frustration (breaking your leg on a 2 foot fall. It's a game guys, relax). ArmA 3 has found a good balance between an FPS/3rd Person shooter game and realism, making it extremely enjoyable as both a simulator [i] and [/i] a game. I also found that ArmA 3 has very good support for newbies to the series and is able to really engage players into the fun. I imagine it is much easier to get into ArmA 3 than I did ArmA 2 (I can't judge, I'm not new to it). 

The engine is decently optimized and is far less clunkier than the ArmA 2 engine, however rocks are still (and I guess forever will be) broken. Perhaps the game is having difficulty conforming such free player movement with an un-even surface. 

Pro tip: NEVER WALK ON ROCKS UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.

The game also has a variety of content; although players coming over from 2 will notice that there are A LOT less guns. This is partly due to the customization of guns. Instead of having a separate gun for each gun variation (M4A1 HOLO, M4A1 CCO, M4A1) you have a base gun and you are able to add sights, lasers, silencers, flashlights, what have you. However, this is not a full excuse- I feel that there are still a lesser amount of overall GUNS to shoot. Perhaps Bohemia Interactive is trying to fine-tune each gun into the patches as opposed to adding a ton of mediocre weapons simply for variety's sake. What's also very surprisingly good in this game is the Nvidia PhysX that was incorporated. Seeing my transport truck's wheels constantly bumping up and down according to the land under me while I drive troops through the night is oh-so-satisfying as well as, well... realistic! The physics engine has been extremely improved and I quite like it.

I'd like to finally talk about how the guns shoot and how they sound, for this is after all, a big part of the game. Once again I will compare it to ArmA 2, in saying clearly that ArmA 2 featured a more high-pitched ""tappy"" sound when you shot with vertical recoil, while 3 brings a much more deeper, louder shot as well as echo to accompany it as the gun travels backwards into your viewmodel as opposed to upwards. The guns definitely feel better for me, but in the end I'd like to classify this judgment as personal preference.

Lastly, the gamemodes of ArmA 3 are diverse and excellent, my favourite being Wasteland script. I won't go into detail here. There is also King of Hill, DayZ (OF COURSE, but it's MEH) and of course standard operations. Altis Life is also a really sweet one! Check those out if you end up buying.

So yeah, I really like this game and I think that there is so much potential for a growing community. Grab some buddies, hop into Stratis and keep overwatch with some snipers and riflers as you and your team move in through the bushes to grab an objective for more supplies for your squad! Really great game, I'd definitely recommend to any FPS/MILSIM fan! :D"
76561198257508149,107410,True,0.881924927234649658,"Arma 3 taught me that 25 fps is playable.
"
76561197963644421,107410,True,0.881744086742401123,"If you're coming to Arma 3 as an Arma series veteran, you already know what to expect. For the most part, the game hasn't changed since the last installment, but then it's always felt a little bit like Bohemia Interactive are still building on the groundwork laid back in 2001 by Operation Flashpoint, in the world's longest ever game of 'development Buckaroo'. Thankfully, the whole thing has yet to fall to pieces in any significant manner; it's quite happy to continue wobbling uneasily for now.

Arma has a reputation. It's known to be frighteningly obtuse, bewilderingly complex, and often hilariously broken. I can tell you right now that Arma 3 is no different, and absolutely still deserves that reputation. Thankfully, I don't think it's unfair to say that this is the closest an Arma game has come to being 'user friendly'. The controls have been tweaked, and the interface refined a little to accommodate more modern tastes. For these improvements alone, I do recommend it to newcomers to the series over any previous entry.
Coming from any other modern FPS game, it will still take a good few hours of what can feel an awful lot like hard work to get to grips with the controls, but I honestly think Arma 3 will see a far lower 'drop-out rate' of newbies who were frustrated to the point of giving up by the previous games.

At the time of writing, the elephant in the room is the lack of content available. When compared to Arma 2 (which is handsomely bolstered by an array of official expansion packs), the amount of hardware available to play with is frustratingly slim. In many cases, opposing armies are equipped with identical vehicles which get a slightly different paint job at best. For anyone used to the myriad of variants and oddments available in Arma 2, Arma 3 can feel awfully disappointing.
Fortunately, this is alleviated to some extent by the strong mod community. It has long been the case that the best parts of the Arma games are the parts not developed by Bohemia Interactive themselves, and Arma 3 is most definitely continuing this 'tradition'. Nevertheless, I can't help but feel that the game could've done with a few months more time in the oven before full public release.

Speaking of the mod community, I think it's criminal that almost none of the best, near-indispensible mods from Arma 2 have been officially integrated. For a self-professed 'war simulator', Arma 3 is hugely lacking in basic features like being able to rest your weapon on surfaces (even with a visible bipod), or tow damaged vehicles.

For all its flaws, though, Arma 3 is still a blast to play. If you can find a decent group of like-minded gamers with access to a voice-over-net server, you're in for some of the best gaming you'll ever experience. Sure, you'll probably have to load up on mods to satisfy your need for variety. And sure, sometimes the game will crash spectacularly, or the physics engine will flip out and kill you for standing too close to a wall. But when you're standing on a hilltop, looking out over an enemy outpost with your squadmates while a CAS helicopter strafes an enemy APC and spots targets for a distant sniper team; when everything clicks together in the way that only Arma can manage, you'll be glad to have been along for the ride."

76561198019977288,107410,True,0.875654399394989014,"I don't know where to start with this but let's just try:

My first experience with ArmA was with the Operation Flashpoint Series and later on with ArmA 1 (Cold war Assault) and then ArmA 2 (+ all possible Add-Ons).
And i just have to say, that i freakin fell in love with this game (ArmA3) from the very begining.

Sure there were heaves of problems, bugs and shit going wrong at the beginning but i still bought this game as soon as it was availabe (Which should've been like early Alpha or so).

But to explain why i sank over propably 2000 hours of my life into this game:

-Versatility: With the workshop added and all the mod support the game offers, it's just incredible for how long you are able to find new stuff. New Maps, weapons, uniforms, AI-Units, vehicles, helicopers, tanks, etc. etc.

-Versitility: With the ZEUS Modul and the Ed3n Editor you are able to creato soooooo much stuff. You can create YOUR OWN scenarios, and the overview them and change them while playing with zeus. if you play with a few people and you keep changing the missio maker you never ever ever run out of ideas/scenarios to play.

-Versitilititititiy: I think we've bee here before... With the huge mod support theres other beefits aswell. If you are playing onlie you will be able to find all sorts of server. wether you like playing as a lone wolf and kill other players, play in a huge team vs. AI encampments/bases, or just get flipping rich with selling apples. there's something for everyone out there.

But i don't want to hail everythig into the sky here, so here's a few negatives, which imo you should kow before you buy this:

-This game is in NO regards something for people lookig for a run & gun game. It's a Mil Sim after all.
-With the milsim aspect comes the complication of finding key bindings for everything you want to be able to do. so be preapared to learn buttloads of them (Especially with TFAR and ace in play).
-The graphics may look BRILLIANT on a good rig but if you are on minimum specs prepare for some frame problems,
 especially on bigger servers (although i have to say BI optimized a lot with the last few updates)

But other then that i can really just recommend this game if you are into military shooters that own you huge piles of different stuff.

And since my ""N"" key is fucked, here are some Ns for you guys that made it this far: n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n
That should've made up for the missed ones.

76561198030752353,107410,True,0.973724424839019775,"Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that it‚Äôs developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But it‚Äôs even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. 

At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the game‚Äôs complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your ass depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. 

Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3‚Äôs two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as I‚Äôm stuck on one mission that I simply can‚Äôt seem to complete.)

However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves.

Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). I‚Äôm sure there are so many others that I haven‚Äôt even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game.

In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless.  

Purchase this game. Purchase it now. Thank me later.

It‚Äôs grown alongside me, and has created some of the most memorable moments I‚Äôve ever experienced in a videogame. It‚Äôs one of those games which, when it finally ‚Äòclicks‚Äô with you, never quite leaves you. You always find yourself going back to it. It‚Äôs not a game which necessarily empowers you like DOOM or Wolfenstein, but the pay-off from successfully pulling off that mission, that flank, that firing solution, that landing, even that single shot, is unparalleled. 

I‚Äôll always remember the moody fog of the APEX Protocol co-op missions as me and my friend crawled through the jungle, silently taking out patrols hunting for us with flashlights dancing in the dark. I‚Äôll always remember finally Escaping from Tanoa after six hours with my mates ‚Äî it felt like a hiking trip by the end. I‚Äôll always remember staying prone in a ghillie suit as a whole platoon of Russians patrolled past my squad, just like in All Ghillied Up. No other game can recreate the thrill or complexity of these memories in an emergent and inherently personal manner. 

My friends and I, after ten years, have talked for hours about that one mission which went so wrong or that incredible shot one of us made across a whole valley, or just how much we associate some terrains like Sahrani or Stratis with our first years as teenagers back at school. ARMA, for me, is an experience equal in its thrills and frustrations as it is in its nostalgia ‚Äî you come to learn these towns, these fields, these roads and valleys and recall them each as affectionately as the other. Sure, things go wrong: a miscommunication is made, a helicopter crashes, the physics engine freaks out, or the server messes up, but most of the time, you‚Äôll laugh through it. 

ARMA is unlike any other game ‚Äî any other experience. I think this ramble has been quite open in displaying just how much it means to me, and how much it will continue to mean to me. I can assure you, if you give it a chance, it will quickly mean as much to you too."

[h1]*I recommend this particularly for its multiplayer.[/h1]

+ Extremely mod friendly; enjoys full support from the Steam Workshop
+ Visuals & environmental design, save for a few issues here and there (i.e. empty buildings), has largely aged well & looks fantastic
+ Employs a deeply challenging level of realism
+ Multiplayer is still very active; boasts a wonderful variety of gameplay & modded servers to choose from
+ Long, content-packed single player campaign; player choices do affect potential endings, as there are several
+ Time control is back from Arma 2; player can speed up the passage of time, which helps SIGNIFICANTLY to combat the monotony of walking/running very long distances between objectives
+ Enormous map/playable area
+ User-created scenarios & a very easy-to-use scenario creator
+ Boasts incredibly varied gameplay mechanics; from piloting/driving myriad vehicles & gunships, to underwater missions, & everything in-between
+ Map & squad mechanics are back; while they may feel clunky to use in a combat scenario, a little practice goes a long way & serves to open up a slew of options on the battlefield

- Sound design is very hit & miss; some weapons sound identical to others, & vehicle sound effects tend to sound strangely muted
- Dialogue is also hit & miss; while I found the voice-acting to be done largely well, some of the dialogue is a bit awful
- Soundtrack often felt cheesy or inappropriate
- Mission pacing often feels very uneven; I felt that it often leaned too far into the realm of the tedious in the interest of realism (shouldn't be a bad thing in theory, but for the pruposes of a video game, it can put players to sleep in some missions)
- The initial learning curve is considerable, & the tutorial felt inadequate overall; mechanics are amazing on paper, but take an inordinate amount of time to master

76561197965925721,107410,True,0.955902099609375,"This is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming, this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things. Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality. There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release.

One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s.

As we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon. We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols. Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower.

There I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower. I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position. But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed.

As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive.

Falling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command. I had done it. I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive.

That is what this game is about."

Decide to give it another shot but play by its rules and you find that you actually enjoy its complexity. Then somebody comes over and says, you wanna try this but Vietnam and also be in a unit with other dipshits that enjoy this game and you say yes because Vietnam sounds awesome (Spoiler: Its not) and you want to play with a more organized group. 

When you wake up, you have spent 4 years playing with the same group of people, while having 20 FPS on lowest settings and the game is keeping 1 of your week days hostage as you have scheduled events every week. You also subscribe to the Steam forums and check reddit to find more victims to sacrifice to BI so as to have their next patch not fuck up all the 58+ mods you are using 1 hour before your operations...

What Im trying to say is: ARMA is not a game, simulation or the answer to the question: How can I commit a war crimes but not be punished for it. Its the friends we made a long the way to commit those war crimes, every flipped convoy that ruins the operation 15 minutes from starting, its the AI shooting your though 30 layers of foliage, its the enemy artillery firing once but the shell exploding 6  times over a 3km radius, every new guy throwing a grenade under your feet while you play dress up in the arsenal, laughing your ass off as your Zeus tries to spice things up with roll playing, crying as Zeus retaliates for killing his roll play doll for ""lols"", every insane AT shot made by one of your guys, every terribly fired RPG you did, its every time the AI some how flanked you and every time you fight your way though it. 

ARMA is everything and nothing and I cant recommend it enough.

edit: this is a cry for help"
76561198007471493,107410,True,0.94609987735748291,"Where do I start with Arma 3...

 1st of all, have I played enough of this game? No, not in the slightest. My total playtime (see above) is pathetic in comparison to those around me. I see upwards of 2000, 3000, 4000 hours just looking at the reviews currently. At the time of writing this review, I sit on a measly 61 hours of gameplay, so I am in no way an expert of this game. 

 What I CAN  tell you is that there are moments in that 61 hours of gameplay that I will probably never forget. This game makes you feel things you won't feel in any other shooter. Call of Duty thrives on high adrenaline, rapid paced combat. Battlefield slows it down a bit, but maintains a good balance of action and spacing between engagements. 

 Arma 3 is a completely different ballpark. There is a LOT of spacing between engagements, which adds massive suspense and makes every firefight very, very meaningful. When combat initiates, there is definately adrenaline pumping action, but it's not fast. Combat is very slow, almost methodical (just like real life) but very, very... awesome. Some things that you'll see in an Arma firefight that you will not see anywhere else:
 - Engagements will be very long distance, often hundreds of meters away, especially if you're roaming the hills or open wilderness. Enemies may only be a fleck in your scope, on another hill entirely, several football fields away from you.
 - You often won't know where you're getting shot from if you're taken by surprise. You don't get any indicators that say ""Hey! someone to your left just shot you!"". Instead, you'll be forced to take cover and locate the enemy the old fashioned way: watching and listening.
 - If you get shot, you probably wont have time to react. One or two shots will kill you without much warning.
 - Teamplay is CRUCIAL. Medics, Anti-Tank, Heavy Gunners all have a part to play in their teams success. 
 - Communication on a whole other level. There is a radio/audio system in the game that is essential to a squad's success. Squad leaders will be vocal, squadees must be willing to take orders and communicate with their superioirs. Directions will not be called out like ""LEFT! RIGHT!"" but rather with compass bearings such as ""There's at least 3 of them at... 248""
 - Stand/Crouch/Prone is also at another level entirely. You can also hunch over, stand up super tall, sit down, lean on your side, bend your body left and right etc.. Manipulating these stances and using them to show as little of you as possible may be a key factor on whether you live or die
 - Every move you make has a pro and a con attached to it. Fire your weapon? Might kill someone, but you might also give your position away or get shot as you peak out of cover. Forget to look left? Arma teaches that wherever you don't look, there will be something that kills you.
 - NO HITMARKERS. You have to make your own call as to whether or not the guy you just shot is dead. If you make the wrong call, your squad may advance only for one of them to be shot by a (very much alive) enemy solider
 - Tanks and armored vehicles are terrifying. It's not like Battlefield where a tank shows up, everybody continues their daily routines and hopefully somebody with anti tank weaponry deals with the 15 ton chunk of metal. Armored vehicles are terrifyingly powerful with weapons foot soldiers can only dream of. A whole squad of 20 people will immediately hit the deck if one of them shpws up, hoping that their AT guys can do the job because...
  - You don't respawn back into the heat of battle. You reaspawn in a base in the middle of nowhere and you either have to take a helicopter to meet with your squad, or ""HALO jump"", which teleports you to an exaxct location but 6000 feet up in the sky, forcing you to have to use your parachute to land safely. HALO jumping back into combat is suicide. Big shiny glorified baloons make really, really good target practice. That also means...
  - If you lose that aforementioned anti-tank guy, you're hooped unless someone takes the risk and picks the launcher off his dead body. That is, unless the tank/armored car blows him up before he gets there. Then 20 people are stranded with very little to do, which means...
 - Every life counts.

 The combat is unreal. I remember we had to clear this city of enemies, entirely. It took us upwards of an hour, but  we checked every single building, room by room, until, In the center plaza, there he stood; the last man we had to kill. All the other building were checked, and I saw a head poking out behind this obstacle in the dead center of the city,

 ""I found him!"" I yell over the squad's radio, ""Central Garden, straight north"" I notice he pokes his head around the corner. My assault rifle was depleted.

 I knew I should have packed more flipping ammo.
 
 So I pull out my pistol. Fire, miss, fire, miss, rinse andrepeat. I empty my whole clip and the man is not dead. So I reload, and just start Terminator walking my way towards this guy. Firing every round I have. The guy doesn't poke his head out anymore. One clip exhausted, then another. And another. This guy will not die. I least I'm supressing him. 

 Then he pops around, shoots me once. Dead.

 My squad catches up ""What the hell was all that shooting?!"" the commander expresses.
 
 They grenade him. Dead.

 Wish I'd have thought of that sooner. 

 The medic gives me a nice repair. I borrow some mags off of him. We get on the chopper, talking about how wicked that mission was. We get a new one, something about planting a bomb somewhere.

 At this point the squad has bonded. We knew eachothers names, at least. We just kept talking, getting closer to the LZ, mocking the pilot for driving too low to the ground. We land and immediately, the chopper comes under fire.

 ""RUN! SPREAD OUT!""

 The heli blows up before it can leave. We all die in a blaze of glory.

 And I left the game after that.

 I cannot recommend this game enough."
76561198176296555,107410,True,0.944918155670166016,"I spent several years in the army and I gotta say this game is spot on with the training and atmosphere the military provides. I love how difficult this game is, and I love all of the different features the game provides. It is NOT easy to hit a target with an assault rifle from 300 yards in real life, and this game seems to match that same difficulty. Fatigue is a real thing and it seriously hinders your accuracy in real life...Arma 3 makes you stop and catch your breath if you run too far or carry too much gear, or you will have a hard time hitting your target. Enemies are not stupid and they have great vision. I was engaged by two enemies from about 200 yards away and they were using bushes for cover as well as 3-5 second rushes when moving. The AI is more advanced than the average taliban are in real life. haha :p Given my love for the military and for videogames, this one is definitely one of my favorites of all time :D"
76561198130981093,107410,True,0.943312287330627441,"I'm not into arma anymore, but as you can probably tell from the amount of hours I've spent paying this game; I've had an incredible time.

Most of the hours clocked into this game have been spent on roleplay servers. They were so fun back in the day..people weren't too serious, and neither too silly. It was very balanced, very fun. Very replayable.

But arma ain't all about roleplay, so let's talk about other things:

I'll start with combat mechanics, obviously - as the game is all about fighting lol. 
The combat is ABSOLUTELY FLIPPING GREAT! You got things like bullet drop which keeps you on your game, and other things such as weapons becoming less effective as the bullet travels mid-air..you also have very aweosme-looking postures which you can adopt; from laying prone, to sitting on your bum, to crouching, leaning side-to-side, and all dat weird jazz.

It's also very realistic in that, you can only take 1-5 shots before you die pending on which weapon is used against you and what kind of protective gear you have equipped. This means that you have to be VERY careful in-game, otherwise you might just get shot in the head and die. Personally, I enjoy such hardcore mechanics.
Another hardcore mechanic is how damage taken is based on where you are hit on your body. So if you've been shot in the head, you're likely to take a hell of a lot of damage, and this is where armour becomes a huge importance; without armour, you are as vulnerable as a mouse surrounded by a horde of cats. I shouldn't even need to stress how much you need armour! You can go light, or heavy - your choice. The amount you wear does affect movement speed though, so do be careful of that. It also affects how badass you look; I generally like to go light so I look like a badass mofo who is totally capable of destroying anyone who crosses my path lol. Not only that, but your appearance can also affect how easily an enemy can spot you. So if you have a huge bag on your back, and lightly coloured clothes- you can be sure people will spot you with ease.

So yeah. Useful information there, I know. But I am most certainly not done! We have to talk about the tanks, and the awesome vehicles that can totally blow ur balls off!

In arma, there are about 20 different ground vehicles, all unique in both appearance and purpose. You have a few anti-vehicle tanks, a few anti-people tanks, and a few artillery and anti-air tanks. Personally, I love the artillery....they're like mini nukes lol. 

You also have APPACHI ATTACK HELICTOPERS! I mean who doesn't like that!? And some awesome looking submarines and attack planes..and boats :):)
AND CARS WITH MOUNTED TURRETS ON!

Yeah, long-story-short -- arma has tons of vehicles, all awesome in both appearance and nature. Very useful for committing mass-genocide on dem pesky capitalist NATO forces....mmmm, satisfactory

Also sorry for not listing their names. I no good wit dat :(:(

Arma also has lots of game modes to choose from, so you're not restricted to just playing one gamemode and getting bored after an hour. I believe I've already listed one already; roleplay. Others include but are not limited to(due to custom game modes etc); TDM, KOH, KTF, PLAYER VS AI(forgot the official classification, sorry), 5v5 COMPETITIVE MATCHES (like that csgo competitive game mode), custom zombie modes, and survival modes. There are also singleplayer game modes which you can host, such as Zeus or custom Addons which allow for various different gameplay experiences; which brings me to my next topic...

There are loads of mods available on the steam workshop! From halo mods, to Star Wars, to enhanced combat system and mechanic mods, xcom mods, and various others which add more vehicles, factions, armour/clothing, more ai, etc...

The settings menus are also vast and fleshed out in arma, so you can rest assured that you'll be able to configure almost anything you want. 
The game also doesn't require a very high-tier computer to function nominaly, so lag shouldn't really be a problem; especially if you tune down the graphics via the settings menus a bit.

This'll be the last topic within this review; multiplayer.
Multiplayer is obviously a huge part of the game, as I've briefly mentioned previously(with the game modes). This game is almost solely multiplayer-based, but singleplayer is a thing and can be fun, so don't feel restricted. This game being focused mainly on multiplayer is obviously good for playing with friends. You can have much fun playing with friends online in this game, much fun indeed. Lag can be a problem though, so make sure you have a decent internet connection and don't be disappointed if you can't play with a friend based half way across the world from you :) but personally I feel the devs have really improved connectibility over the passed years in terms of multiplayer. Id say it's currently at its peak.

Check this game out. It's relatively cheap for its value, so I advise such.

Apologies if I've missed some flavourful features or mechanics. I'll definitely be sure to edit this review if anyone comes in screaming at me about how I didn't include ""this and that and this and that and this and that"" lol.

We're on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back. I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing.

I run, my Autorifleman runs, my Medic runs. But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across.

Anybody seen Full Metal Jacket all the way through? Remember the sniper scene?

The marksman takes a round in the leg as we're running and goes down. He then takes two more in the chest. The kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here.

     Now that I am at almost 730 hours played at the time of this review's initial publication I thought it was time for me to review my favorite game. This is not going to be a typical review where they say something along the lines of ""swam in the air, 79 out of 10 would be break laws of physics again,"" although that has happened to me and it was hilarious. This is going to be an in depth and honest review of Arma 3.

First though, here is some context.

      When Arma 3 first came out in 2013 I was so excited because I had been watching Arma 2 for so long and I was really hyped on the Arma 3 trailers, not that I actually had a good enough computer to play either one of them of course, so I waited until I finally did. I waited for 3 1/2 years watching YouTube videos and wishing that I could have Arma 3, It was sheer torment. All the cool things that people did just made the situation worse: every valiant last stand against zombies that saved the city, every stealth mission that crippled the enemy, and every close air support gun run that saved a convoy that was under threat just made me want Arma 3 more. So, when I finally had a computer that was good enough to play games on it one of the first games that I got was Arma 3.

       Arma 3 was nothing like I had expected it to be, it was better. An entire virtual sandbox for me to do anything I wanted, go anywhere I wanted, and play any way I wanted. It was not like a ""sophisticated Battlefield"" or a ""Call of Duty on steroids"" like I was expecting it to be, or how I was told it was. Arma 3 is just better. Those descriptions don't even remotely do the game justice. The modding support is astounding to say the least, like I said earlier, zombies. The maps are gorgeous, the weapons are wonderfully modeled, and you have a fully customizable character from the face, to the clothes, to the voice. Arma 3 is more than meets the eye, sure it‚Äôs beautiful, but it also has a great deal of depth behind that gorgeous high polygon count tree, and highly reflective water, and I love it to death for it.

       Arma 3 is in some ways the next logical step for somebody who is into the first person shooter genre, you probably don't know what they say about the game but here it is anyway. ""Children play Call of Duty, boys play Battlefield, men play Arma."" I feel like this statement is true, at least on some levels. The Arma series just feels mature to me, and much more refined than Call of Duty or Battlefield as well. They are not games where you can easily be a""Super Duper MACV Recon SOG SEAL Delta Force Green Beret CIA Operator,"" go ""gunz blazin,"" and kill ""all dem dudes over dere."" Although that sometimes works much to my own surprise and amusement. Arma 3 requires at least some modicum of strategy, or my personal favorite, a great big helping of luck to win, or even be good at in some cases, and I think that is good thing, Arma demands that people invest time into.

       Arma 3 has a large amount of multiplayer content that somebody can enjoy, you can play on a life server and rise through the ranks to become whoever you want to be, whether you want to be are a brutal crime lord, or the mayor of the town. The king of the hill servers bring a nice challenge to Arma 3 where you can fight in and against, in a perfect world, a well organized group of players who are trying very diligently to accomplish their objectives in Arma 3's virtual world. I loved Arma so much that I decided to found a unit which can be found here: join.crabsunion.com

The choice really is up to you on what you want to do in the game, and the built in mission maker with the option to add a ""Zeus"" for mission changes on the fly is always a great option. It is fun to play God for a while, and terrorize your friends.

       The singleplayer content of Arma 3 is quite good, I am very much enjoying the new ""Stepping Stone"" campaign, where NATO forces are trying to seize the picturesque island of Malden in an attempt to attain and maintain aerial dominance over the critically important Strait of Gibraltar.The ""Apex Protocol Campaign"" is very well made in my opinion with several missions that make you feel like you really are a ""Super Duper MACV Recon SOG SEAL Delta Force Green Beret CIA Operator."" Another great thing about the Apex Protocol campaign is that it gives you the option of playing it with friends if you so choose, something I wish the other campaigns did as well.

       Many people say that Arma 3 has a steep learning curve and I disagree. You pick up new things very quickly in Arma 3, or at least I do. Arma 3 just has so much to learn that many people think that it is a very difficult game to play when it is not. Almost every time I play Arma 3 I learn something new about the game or how to play it more effectively. It does not matter whether this is some knowledge about how to use Zeus or make mission more effectively, if it is some new tactic for clearing houses, or even if it is a technique on how to get more stable frame rate. Even with my amount of play time, and the amount of videos I have watched on Arma 3, I am still learning new things constantly. I believe that fact alone sets Arma 3 apart from other games.

       Arma 3 is a somewhat underappreciated treasure in the gaming world with endless content and unlimited scenarios to explore and it deserves more publicity than it is getting. I hope that this review was helpful to you and informative as well. Furthermore I hope that it didn‚Äôt bore you to death too much. Anyways, you have a great day now."

Great game for the more serious war gamer, not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from Call of Duty series which I consider more for the younger gamers anyway.

Arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games, similar to Battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using. You will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10-20 minutes in a single location (sometimes longer, I personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward.

You will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance.

You can not respawn as quickly as you can in CoD if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic.

The graphics are great, the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to.

I recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible (unless doing paintballing or airgunning), and if you do buy the game - I recommend completing the whole VR Tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the Campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game."

August 20th 2019. I was in a Squad of 7 men. I had the duty of a combat life saver. We had to fly oversea's on a Helicopter. I couldn't tell if my pilot was drunk or my dial up internet was making the helicopter do acrobatics but it was intense. About 5 minutes of flying we touch down safely, getting out as my ears immediately explode from my sound mod making the helicopter 5000x louder. It was awesome. We continue down the road for another 200m when a sniper from the treeline blows off one of my boys heads. We all scramble for cover behind the hill. My boy and I had to kill the MMG who were suppressing our men. We take a flank to the left in hopes of gunning this asshole down. Because the AI are fucking superman, me and my boy were immediately spotted and suppressed by sniper fire behind a rock. He gets hit in the chest which caused a velocity wound and other medical wounds. I sew him up like the god I am and we continue down the hill under all sorts of fire. I take a bullet to my arm and leg, making me as slow as a 60 year old asthmatic hippo with 3 legs. I stitch up my wounds and began limping to some more cover. I fix my leg somehow and im mobile again, pushing into the objective we were supposed to take an hour ago. Our NATO squad successfully raided the base. Only 2 men were killed and all CSAT have been eliminated.

Or so we thought.

The man on the radio sounds like his balls dropped off Mount Everest. He tells us CSAT reinforcements will be arriving shortly. I was unprepared with only 3 mags of ammunition and only a few medical bandages and morphine left. After a few minutes of respite, a shot is echoed from the hills and another firefight takes place again. These assholes now have armored cars with .50 guns on them. 4 of our men are killed within seconds. Thankfully i brought AT rockets with me and I take out the armored car. It explodes in a fiery mess, leaving that area scorched. My boy and I take cover behind a shitty jeep as more and more bullets fly over our heads. He gets hit in the chest 2 times and in the leg 3. I'm out of ammunition in both weapons and I am forced to drag him behind a tree. I take a hit to my chest and start to bleed out. Medical supplies are running thin. 

A few minutes passed and the CSAT have stopped firing. They probably thought we all died. I failed to medic my friend as his cold, dead body lay in the grass. I scavenge off my dead teammates for ammo, leaving my aim in the garbage due to the multiple wounds to the arms. Just when I thought all was over, a NATO chopper has came to evacuate me. I have a blood pressure of the exact definition of trash, my heart rate is 50 and my screen is black and white. I'm limping up a hill while taking multiple shots from the CSAT hiding in the thick brush. I am able to get into the chopper and escape as the last man in my squad to live. 

From that day on, I have diagnosed myself with PTSD. Only play if your balls are made of titanium."

76561198123083438,107410,True,0.926028549671173096,"For this review I'm going to open with a price breakdown, because at the end of the day when you're looking at getting a game you're trying to figure out whether or not it's worth it.

[h1]Price Breakdown[/h1]
Full price of the game and all DLC without deals or bundles $200.25

With my 4,000 hours of gameplay that equates to
 $0.0502375 an hour of playtime (Or about 5 cents)
 $1.2057 a day of playtime

Days between 1 August 2016 (When I bought it) and 12 March 2020 (date of this review)
That's 1,319 days or 31,656 hours
 $0.00632581501137225170583775587566‚Ä¨ an hour (or about half a cent)
 $0.15181956027293404094010614101592 a day (Or about 15 cents)


Arma is a near future military sandbox experience that gives players access to play how they want, whether they want to be infantry, tank operators, war journalists, helicopter pilots, jet pilots, boat captains, divers. Arma has something to suit any players wants.

[h1]Are the DLCs worth it?[/h1]
So when we're looking at value it is well worth it. I often run into people going on in lobbies about how Arma is always bringing out DLCs that cost way too much for what they are and that Bohemia is just a moneyhungering company, but when you break it down the level of detail they bring to the table and the time you spend on the content is unparalleled in terms of replayability. Aside from the singleplayer campaigns and the maps introduced in DLCs all of the content is actually free to use whether you own the DLC or not, the only downside is that if you do use something that you don't own the DLC for then a watermark will show up on the side of your screen for a few seconds every five to ten minutes or so.

It seems that in many peoples eyes the most cardinal sins are the Contact DLC and Laws of War DLC. But I only ever hear complaints about them from people that when I get into debates with them they say 'Oh, I forgot Arma had a singleplayer."" or ""Pfffft, no one plays the singleplayer."" But this last statement couldn't be more wrong. In fact in terms of parts of this game that shine, the singleplayer campaigns and missions are a big part of that.

[h1]Singleplayer[/h1]
The way the tutorial seemlessly blends into the story of the larger campaign, to the political turmoil you find yourself being embroiled in, to the intrigue of the moral dilemmas you find yourself asking at the end of the Laws of War campaign. These stories are memorable! If you ever dip your hands in the Zeus gamemode (the veritable Dungeons and Dragons of the Armaverse) you'll often find yourself recreating some of those memorable experiences for other players, such as the uneasy downtime and that suspenseful few moments before a major gunfight.

[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]
If singleplayer isn't your thing then the multiplayer will keep you coming back again and again, whether you want to have a PVP killfest in King of the Hill, a PVE mission based gamemode in Invade and Annex or Antistasi, the aforementioned Zeus gamemode, a roleplay experience in ArmaLife servers, or a hardcore military simulation. Arma has it all. When it comes to the multiplayer, most of my most enjoyable moments have been the downtime in between missions, whether chilling at the base or traveling to the area of operations. Arma multiplayer is a social experience at heart and that's where the multiplayer experience really shines in my eyes. I have met many people over the years that I am still good friends with to this day, and I have Arma to thank for that. We have had good times together and even better stories to tell. When I was first playing this game I didn't have a microphone so I had to type everything I wanted to get across, because of that I inadvertently learnt touch typing, which is pretty strange to say when someone asks you how you learnt to touch type. The official servers can become quite chaotic, but if you find a nice server a community is hosting then that can be like a second home, even with some of the chaotic people in the official servers the community as a whole is the most welcoming community I've come across in a game.

[h1]Community[/h1]
Touching on the community, Arma has a strong and committed modding and content creation community, mainly due to the passion of the users and the easy to use modding and mission creation tools, such as the 3DEN editor, a 3d mission maker contained within the game itself which harkens back to the golden age of Real Time Strategy games, such as Age of Empires. So if what you want to do isn't quite in the game, you're sure to find a mod or a mission that allows you to do that and if you can't there is an abundance of information on how to make it yourself. And with the easeability of sharing modlists, it's easy to bundle all of the mods you need to make the experience you want to play and then share the list with your mates so that you can all play together.

[h1]Is Arma The Game For You?[/h1]
All in all there is a lot of downtime in this game, so if you're all about instant gratification, killstreaks and being the best of the best then this game probably isn't for you. Arma is a team game and a lot of the game is spent walking, travelling or planning which gives you a lot of time to get to know your team. So if you're not into that then this might not be the game for you when it comes to the multiplayer. If you're looking for a game that is a million different games however, Arma is for you. Because every experience is different and with mods it can even be an entirely different game, for an example just look at DayZ or PlayersUnknownBattlegrounds which both started their lives as mods on Arma.

Arma 3, best 4,000 I've spent in a game ever."
76561198097852352,107410,True,0.925913095474243164,"After putting in over 3500 hours, I have seen the good, the bad, and the downright ugly that ARMA III has to offer. With that being said, I offer my review. It will be a bit long, but after this much time in game, there is a lot to discuss. 

First off, the campaign for single player is ok, but not great. You will be able to find other games with better campaign story modes than ARMA III as the main focus is put on the Multiplayer aspect. However, the campaign and story does prove challenging and the story is solid enough to keep you entertained and engaged. 

Secondly, The DLC content is hit or miss. 

GOOD DLC!
-Tanks add several new tanks into the game and make putting a AP round through your enemy a joy!
-Jets add several new jets to wreak havoc with! It also adds a aircraft carrier!
-Marksman adds some of the best sniper rifles in the game period! Also adds several ghillie suits and scopes. 

Decent DLC.
-Helicopters adds two helis to the game. Mostly for heavy lifting. 
-APEX adds an Island called Tanoa. A dozen weapons and gear. A few vehicles and a few VTOL aircraft. 

Bad DLC!
-Karts. Go-karts on a battlefield. Is this a joke?
-Laws of War. A single player mini campaign for a multiplayer focused game.  Not worth your money.
- Tac-Ops. Again, another single player mini campaign in a multiplayer focused game. Not worth your money.

Third on the list in multiplayer. The true fun to be had with ARMA III is through the multiplayer. There are 1000's of servers all with different options to chose from fitting nearly every type and style of game play. Zombies, they got it. Not into Zombies? No problem. Co-op, yep! Role play, check! Survival, you bet! PvP for those that like to kill others and PvE for the more casual crowd can be found.

Fourth. The community of players found in ARMA III are some of the best I have seen. They are often found to be helpful and willing to lend a hand to newer players and also to veterans in need of assistance. With that being said, you will however run into the occasional troublemaker, rule breaker, or very rarely a hacker. Most of them are dealt with swiftly by the server admins. Then, also,  there is those few players who have little time to read the server rules and blindly run off into the battlefield annoying players by doing things they shouldn't. When corrected by others, they will usually reply "" I didn't know the rules. "" A word of advice. When entering a server, read the rules or simply ask in chat and other players will usually be happy to explain them. 

Fifth, the graphics. For a game that is over 5 years old, the graphics are good. Not great mind you, but good to say the least. 

Sixth, the game play. ARMA III focuses on two things. Realistic militarised game play and multiplayer action via servers. Most of the servers run mods created by people like you and me. Some are about survival and will have you scrounging the map for supplies and gear. Some are about playing team death-match. Some are co-op missions. They can be very fun and can add a lot of vehicles, maps, gear, aircraft, weapons, scenarios, and more to the game. However, no one is prefect and you will find yourself dead periodically after simply opening a door, walking down stairs, entering a vehicle, exiting a vehicle, etc. The point is, expect the unexpected. While this does not happen all the time, you most definitely will encounter a few bugs and glitches from time to time. The most common and frustrating is the sudden vanishing of vehicles left at your base. ARMA loves to eat vehicles for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Also, it will eat your gear, weapons, base, and well....pretty much anything.  So don't get too attached to your stuff. As a server admin for several different servers, I have spent entire days replacing lost items. However, do not expect all admins to be as accommodating as losing items in ARMA is all part of the game.

In all, ARMA III can be a very fun game to play. It's strength comes from the almost limitless ways the game can be played on the 1000's of available servers. After all this time, I still find myself spending the weekends running missions on several servers. In the end, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes realistic military style games."

311 days ago i was Developer banned from Arma 3. The day before i received this ban i had decided to download arma after months away from it. I downloaded the game, it remembered all my mods, downloaded them then i fired the game up.

Do you lads feel out of sorts some times and you sit looking at you vast steam library wondering what to play. Its kinda like choosing a film on Netflix, before you know it times up and you cant be bothered. It was like that. I sat in the in game menu for one minute (screen shot to prove it) before deciding not to play. I exited the game, steam and shut down my PC. 

The following day i decided i was going to fully get back into it. I loaded up my computer. Steam automatically opened but this time with a message. You have been banned from the following games (ARMA 3).

It stated i was banned by the developer. I immediately thought why the hell was i banned. I contacted BI within ten minutes. The response was the same as it remains today. 'we do not deal with bans, battleye do. Please contact battleye if you need support with a ban.' 

BUT YOU DO DEAL WITH BANS - THIS IS A DEV BAN NOT A BE BAN????

I spent the last 10 months contacting BE who eventually responded to tell me that they did not ban me nor did they find anything on my PC that was suspicious to them at the time of my ban. They informed my my logs were 'spotless'

I swung my attention back around to BI. I contacted them the other day. A chap called Dominik responded saying the ban was a battleye ban not a DEV ban.  I have since sent him images of my ban stating it was a DEV ban, steams explanation of a DEV BAN which states a developer informs valve of an account that is suspicious and valve ban them. I have sent images of my conversation with BE and proof that in the two weeks before my ban i had one minute of game time which was spent in the menu. 

The emails have fallen of deaf ears.....No response from Dominik. 

I am absolutely heart broken that from the past 10 months i have been unable to play with my friends and it looks like this situation is not going to change. I am disgusted as the lack of acknowledgement and willingness to support and resolve this from BI. 

I have so many fond memories in Arma 2, OH & 3 but it looks like this is the end of the road for me. I will miss the random chats in game, the communities i was part of and the battles of the field.

76561198061912275,107410,True,0.910561800003051758,"Arma 3 is like that long-term girlfriend/boyfriend you date where, at the honeymoon phase, you are smitten and are like ""wow, this is a 10/10 unique experience."" However, as the months turn to years and time rolls on, you start to realize there are shinier, prettier experiences out there- better looks, sexier moves, more stable, but you stick with it. You realize you're really with a solid 7/10, but **** is it fun. There are things he/she can do that no one else can, and well, despite deviations time to time to fantasize about other experiences, and several on-again/off-again times spent dabbling in those fantasies, you find yourself coming back to him/her. You find yourself truly happy...even after the worst (and unstable) times. Come to think of it, maybe this isn't a healthy relationship, but at the end of the day, it's a **** fun one.

Arma is an unstable, buggy ride and a bit overwhelming on first impressions, but it's an experience that you don't get in any other sandbox game or military shooter. The community is really what drives this game. It's a quasi-sim/quasi-arcade experience that can be tailored to the community/user's need given a little time spent learning how it all works. The developers do a decent job of providing documentation to understand how content creation and mission editing functions, and the community fills (and exceeds) the areas unfulfilled and self-imagined. There are few communities as diverse and robust as Arma's. In one night's events, you can go from playing a modern-day military sim night with your homies, to WWII, Vietnam, then Star Wars, Halo, Starship Troopers, Aliens, to the bloody revolutionary war and more. In short, Arma should be judged more as a sandbox & framework for community addons than a game on its own, and one that over the last 6 years developed into being highly accessible to the average user without even needing to touch a text editor or understand how it works to get custom games going through its implementation of a ""Dungeon Master"" style mission builder called ""Zeus."" Arma's experience varies greatly depending on your level of tolerance for troubleshooting and patience with searching/installing addons. 

This is best experienced by being dragged in by a community of friends... really it's kind of Stockholm Syndrome that kept me in it to start, and the incredible, fun, sometimes frustrating, and hilarious experiences made along the way is something no other game has offered and keeps me coming back. Give it a go, or watch some communities stream their experiences and see for yourself."

76561197979139992,107410,True,0.908434510231018066,"Well after playing this game for a few hours I thought it was about time to write a review.

I struggle to think of many games past or present that manage to do what Arma 3 does. Before the impending praise I'm about to give this game I will say 2 things. 

First, there will be bugs. Not the Starship Troopers kind... Well actually you can kill bugs as a Starship Trooper but I'm talking glitches, rubber banding, inventory issues, layer upon layer of mods causing compatibility issues and the list goes on. You simply have to embrace these problems and make them part of the enemy which you have to overcome! If you are easily put off by the above, Arma isnt for you, in fact the way games are pushed out these days a don't think many games would be for you.

Second, so far I have spent ¬£150 on this game (not including money spent on my own private server endeavours and donations to other public server communities) which sounds and is slightly ridiculous HOWEVER I have spent over 6000 hours on this game which is more than the rest of my steam library combined so as a time spent versus money paid its the cheapest game I've ever bought. All I say to anyone who somehow doesn't own it yet is wait for a Steam super sale and buy everything in one nice discount and your laughing!

The above remain the only 2 reasons I would not recommend this game, price Inc all dlc and the constant battle with bugs etc. All that aside Arma 3 is simply one of the best things you can buy for your PC. From the seemingly infinite Steam Workshop content to the fact that you can do anything from Milsim team based combat to simple PvP to cooperative missions to RPG style game modes to racing mods and a small off shoot you may have heard of called DayZ (Arma 2 mod but ya know what I'm getting at) it really does tick every box. There is a huge learning curve in the form of keybindings. It takes time just finding the right section to rebind keys but once you are comfortable I find the control of your character, chopper, jet, quad bike, humvee, tank, golf caddy etc quite intuitive. No other game gives you as many stances to be in. You can literally find a stance which gives you line of sight through a small hole in a wall at any angle. There are basic and advanced settings for flying so you can feel like a pro or take it easy with simplified physics and controls.

One final word... Community! As with all games you are bound to find trolls and people too competitive to remember what manners are, however on the whole Arma has a great community of players. I play 90% coop missions these days and it is just a breath of fresh air to be playing multiplayer on such a grand scale without this furious and frantic atmosphere which is so prominent in most multilayer games these days. After the demise of the Battlefield franchise after BC2 and BF3 I really needed a game to fill my need for military shooters and Arma 3 came to my rescue.

Rather than go on and on, all I will end on saying is that this game is more like a template for you to then decide what you actually want to spend your time doing. If you are on the fence, browse the workshop and see the sheer amount of 5 star community made content from overhaul mods to subtle quality of life mods. You could spend 6000 hours just playing all the single player campaigns made by other users."

One day, not so long ago, my squad had just destroyed an anti-air battery. Our pilot landed, and the rest of the squad boarded one by one. I was about to get in when the rockets started flying.

The chopper lifted off, with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes. Unwilling to die before then, I rushed to the nearest cover, a small house by a narrow road. I entered to find a ten year-old player who had also been left behind. He explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his ""clan"".

I politely declined, explaining that my own squad was inbound. As I finished, a Ghost Hawk flew over the horizon. My squad had arrived.

This noble child soldier and I were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting. The sniper screamed as a 6.5 mm cartridge entered his leg. His shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as I climbed in the transport.

Grossly outdated graphics engine, poorly optimised, it remains the closest game you can ever play to the real thing. During its heyday, milsim communities and modders made this more of an experience than some simple combat simulator - I was able to don exactly the same equipment, uniform and loadouts that I served with while in the army.
NOT worth it if you're playing vanilla arma - terrifying and immersive if you use mods.
You can eat, climb walls, abseil, drink, splint fractures, dress burns, dig foxholes, engage in melee, interrogate, be suppressed and find yourself in a house being breached and cleared by the enemy.
Unless it's vanilla...
Mods are everything."

76561197971414496,107410,True,0.896043360233306885,"Arma 3 is a tricky game to review, but here‚Äôs me trying it anyway.

The reason why this game is so hard to review lies in the sheer size of the game and the variety of things it may or may not offer for the player.

I take Arma 3 for what it is first and foremost: a platform. What you get is a good looking game with a solid (would be great, but you have to do some optimization to boost your performance) engine, two amazing maps (Stratis and Altis, which is probably the most impressive map I‚Äôve seen in any open world-ish game) and the prospect of near endless new content from the community.

What you don‚Äôt get is an easy to get into mil-shooter with CoD sized maps and a quick pace. If you‚Äôre in for uncomplicated, fast paced PvP gameplay, you should probably look elsewhere. If you‚Äôre sick of that, however, Arma 3 might be just your thing. 

The strength of the Arma series is freedom (**** yeah). You are free to mod the game into almost anything you want, create any type of mission and make your very own gameplay experience. You have to invest some time into the game, but once you got into it, the opportunities are endless.

Want to play huge adversial or coop maps with a hundred players or more?  Arma is just your thing and there are big communities (in many different languages) that will help you find that epic experience.

Want to play singe player? Well, if you expect strong single player content with interesting characters and storyline and so on, then Arma 3 isn‚Äôt the game you‚Äôre looking for.  Or is it? Right now Bohemia delivered one part of a three part campaign ‚Äì those missions are challenging, offer a solid variety of infantry gameplay but don‚Äôt expect a good story or interesting characters. But as mentioned before ‚Äì the huge amount of community made missions and mods offer hours and hours of playtime.

Personally I prefer small cooperative missions to play with friends. Already the steam workshop has countless missions for 2-5 players. 

So, should you buy Arma 3? Well, I‚Äôd certainly recommend it, if any of the things I mentioned above sounds fun to you. It is to say though, that this game is not something that everyone might like, so stay away from it if you are not willing to invest some time into it.

I hope that this review helped some people to decide whether or not they should by Arma 3. Please note that I‚Äôm not a native English speaker, so the language used in this review might seem a little odd for some."

Briefly, I remember that every single second I've played this game is my favorite memory. As I do so, the developer's splash screen flashes on the screen, followed by the warm  welcome of the ARMA III logo and subsequent main menu screen. In this moment, I feel happy and fulfilled. The events of the real world bear no importance to me as I undertake the task of deciding what I'm going to get myself into today. Shall it be Altis life antics? Do I recreate the Osama Bin Laden raid with my friends? Should I attempt to put myself into the shoes of a Marine in the middle of the Tet Offensive of late 1968? My mind wanders into the child-like curiosity and the uncertainty of the events that will take place tonight, and therefore I am excited. This is my conscious mind. My subconscious, however, is aware of one simple, true fact. I am free."
76561198061699977,107410,True,0.889143705368041992,"[h1] The Big A3 [/h1]

[b] Welcome to Arma 3: The Big One [/b]

If you didn't just start PC gaming an hour ago, you've probably heard of Arma 3. Every time someone says the names Call of Duty, Battlefield, Squad, Red Orchestra, Verdun, or any other shooter title out there, they do so in hushed tones and with their hands over their mouths for fear of the inevitable tongue-lashing they're about to receive from an Arma fan.
Fans of the Arma series are fiercly loyal and totally uncompromising. I have little doubt you've heard the following phrases:

[list]
[*]""If you want [i] realism, [/i] you should play Arma.""
[*]""Only casuals play. . . .""
[*]""Arma 3 is way better because . . . .  and  . . . . ""
[/list]

It's annoying and inarguably elitist but, in their defense, also mostly true. Arma 3 is not for someone who is looking for a casual shooter experience. Arma 3 is for those of us that want to camp out in the trees, waiting for the three guys you saw 30 minutes before, and hoping you can pull of a successful ambush quickly, quietly, and without getting hit. Then, walking for another 30 minutes to link up with another squad, grab some vehicles, and truck a few kilometers out to set up a new FOB. You can expect to go upwards of 3 hours without firing a shot on certain servers.

Which brings me to my next point. . . 

[b] The Game Within a Game Within a Game Within a Game. . . . [/b]

One of A3's major selling points is it's massive, active, dedicated, and diverse community of modders. Arma 3 has a great single player campaign and a few nice King of the Hill and Wasteland servers that you will want to visit occasionally, but Arma gets particularly interesting when you go mod shopping. 

in the mood to lose track of 30 hours while you're dodging police officers and rival gangs as you fight to expand your criminal empire across Altis and/or Tanoa?
Asylum 'Life' servers are a personal favorite of mine. Complete with a living, player-driven economy, impactful politics between gangs and a police force trying to keep control of the island as these gangs throw lead and shade at one another in a constant struggle for turf. If that sounds familiar to you, make no mistake, GTA V doesn't come close to touching the complexity of Life servers.

There are mods for different eras of warfare, gamemodes for about anything you can imagine, and you can find most of them on Steam Workshop, making it easy to access and giving you infinite playtime. You literally cannot run out of things to do because there is [i] always [/i] more content.

I could honestly write about Arma all evening but I'll leave you with a few pros and cons and then I'll wrap things up for you.

[b] PROS: [/b]
[list]
[*]Infinite play value, you can never run out of content
[*]satisfying and memorable moments come to those with patience
[*]game modes for almost everything thanks to the modding community
[*]great graphics for excellent immersion
[*]Endless selection of weapons, vehicles, gear, etc.
[*]Shed your 'casual' title and pick up the mark of 'master' gamer
[/list]

[b] CONS: [/b]
[list]
[*]Arma 3 is not well optimized and is very CPU intensive. Still perfectly playable at 30fps though you will need a high end i7 if you expect to get anywhere near 60fps on most multiplayer servers. AMD users be warned.
[*]Seriously not for casual gamers. I cannot stress this enough. It can take hours to accomplish simple goals depending on your game mode. Highly satisfying when things come together, though.
[*]Expect to move slowly while learning controls. Arma 3 is a game that uses just about [i] all [/i] of your keyboard and it will take you a while to master.

[b] But Should I Buy It? [/b]

I can't recommend this game enough. But if you're a die-hard Call of Duty fan but you still pick up this title, you're in for a rude awakening. Casual gamers be warned."
76561198072447858,107410,True,0.889115750789642334,"What did you do today? I did walk into a stopsign and died in Arma 3.
Meh.. After 3099 hours and 15000 deaths later it's still a game you will return back to.
Thumbsup all the way."
76561198026803446,107410,True,0.888425886631011963,Just buy it. Look at how many hours I have in this game. It's the best money you'll ever spend. It is all things to all gamers.
76561197995591955,107410,True,0.88792949914932251,"Can't tell you if you should buy it or not, but I can tell you this.
You will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isn't there and lack of content if you're not satisfied with what you have. 
But when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, it's something magical you just can't find in any other game.

Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly.
Arma is a game which you can never called finished. There will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations. 

Hope I expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :)

If you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem!

I'll give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, I've used hundreds of hours on Arma 3 that I would never take back.

I radio in a sniper nest and a patrol with a BTR for artillery support. 

Before I can finish giving approx co-ordinates to my team leader I get screamed at down the radio by someone in my group (I could hear his radio and local vox):

""ARE YOU F*CKING SERIOUS?! THIS IS MEANT TO BE A MILSIM SERVER AND YOU HAVEN'T EVEN ALTERED YOUR F*CKING RADIO""

Turns out this 40y.o. was mad at me because I didn't install a mod that makes the radio go ""be-be-boop"" when you break transmission.

The bugs, the poor-optimization (which has greatly improved, and I suspect most complaints come from people who don't know/care how to adjust the game settings). That being said, there's a reason why so many players in the review section have 1000+ hours in spite of this. You will simply will not find a game like this anywhere else. 

Now, some people don't care much for the realism, and prefer action-movie esque shooters. That's fine. However, this game shines at gritty realistic firefights. There's nothing glorious about shouting contact reports into the radio, bounding cover to cover, and hoping the next round doesn't have your name on it, but when you're finally back on the bird with your buddies headed home, and you finally feel the sense of relief wash over you.

76561198049422365,107410,True,0.882125139236450195,"Being an avid ArmA 2 Wasteland/DayZ player back in the day (about 1.5 years ago), I relished the thought of a new ArmA coming out. ArmA 2 was practically uknown until it's popularity was increased by DayZ. I found it interesting to jump into a BI (Bohemia Interactive) title that already had a steady fan-base behind it. Having been about a year since I purchased this game (launch) and over 100 hours of solid gameplay I feel that I can finally write a review that encompasses many of the aspects I have experienced within this game. Now I know what you're thinking: ""$59.99?! This isn't even considered a triple A title! That's like... that's like the price of CoD: Ghosts!"" Now, don't be intimidated by this price, for I can say that off the bat this game is worth a lot more than $59.99. From a value perspective, I found the price to be very reasonable based on the game's content nowadays.

Basically, ArmA is a series of hardcore military simulation; constantly reflecting real-world conditions into a video game. In ArmA 2, I feel that this was it's drawback, for there were certain scenarios where it was realistic to a point of frustration (breaking your leg on a 2 foot fall. It's a game guys, relax). ArmA 3 has found a good balance between an FPS/3rd Person shooter game and realism, making it extremely enjoyable as both a simulator [i] and [/i] a game. I also found that ArmA 3 has very good support for newbies to the series and is able to really engage players into the fun. I imagine it is much easier to get into ArmA 3 than I did ArmA 2 (I can't judge, I'm not new to it). 

The engine is decently optimized and is far less clunkier than the ArmA 2 engine, however rocks are still (and I guess forever will be) broken. Perhaps the game is having difficulty conforming such free player movement with an un-even surface. 

Pro tip: NEVER WALK ON ROCKS UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.

The game also has a variety of content; although players coming over from 2 will notice that there are A LOT less guns. This is partly due to the customization of guns. Instead of having a separate gun for each gun variation (M4A1 HOLO, M4A1 CCO, M4A1) you have a base gun and you are able to add sights, lasers, silencers, flashlights, what have you. However, this is not a full excuse- I feel that there are still a lesser amount of overall GUNS to shoot. Perhaps Bohemia Interactive is trying to fine-tune each gun into the patches as opposed to adding a ton of mediocre weapons simply for variety's sake. What's also very surprisingly good in this game is the Nvidia PhysX that was incorporated. Seeing my transport truck's wheels constantly bumping up and down according to the land under me while I drive troops through the night is oh-so-satisfying as well as, well... realistic! The physics engine has been extremely improved and I quite like it.

I'd like to finally talk about how the guns shoot and how they sound, for this is after all, a big part of the game. Once again I will compare it to ArmA 2, in saying clearly that ArmA 2 featured a more high-pitched ""tappy"" sound when you shot with vertical recoil, while 3 brings a much more deeper, louder shot as well as echo to accompany it as the gun travels backwards into your viewmodel as opposed to upwards. The guns definitely feel better for me, but in the end I'd like to classify this judgment as personal preference.

Lastly, the gamemodes of ArmA 3 are diverse and excellent, my favourite being Wasteland script. I won't go into detail here. There is also King of Hill, DayZ (OF COURSE, but it's MEH) and of course standard operations. Altis Life is also a really sweet one! Check those out if you end up buying.

So yeah, I really like this game and I think that there is so much potential for a growing community. Grab some buddies, hop into Stratis and keep overwatch with some snipers and riflers as you and your team move in through the bushes to grab an objective for more supplies for your squad! Really great game, I'd definitely recommend to any FPS/MILSIM fan! :D"
76561198257508149,107410,True,0.881924927234649658,"Arma 3 taught me that 25 fps is playable.
"
76561197963644421,107410,True,0.881744086742401123,"If you're coming to Arma 3 as an Arma series veteran, you already know what to expect. For the most part, the game hasn't changed since the last installment, but then it's always felt a little bit like Bohemia Interactive are still building on the groundwork laid back in 2001 by Operation Flashpoint, in the world's longest ever game of 'development Buckaroo'. Thankfully, the whole thing has yet to fall to pieces in any significant manner; it's quite happy to continue wobbling uneasily for now.

Arma has a reputation. It's known to be frighteningly obtuse, bewilderingly complex, and often hilariously broken. I can tell you right now that Arma 3 is no different, and absolutely still deserves that reputation. Thankfully, I don't think it's unfair to say that this is the closest an Arma game has come to being 'user friendly'. The controls have been tweaked, and the interface refined a little to accommodate more modern tastes. For these improvements alone, I do recommend it to newcomers to the series over any previous entry.
Coming from any other modern FPS game, it will still take a good few hours of what can feel an awful lot like hard work to get to grips with the controls, but I honestly think Arma 3 will see a far lower 'drop-out rate' of newbies who were frustrated to the point of giving up by the previous games.

At the time of writing, the elephant in the room is the lack of content available. When compared to Arma 2 (which is handsomely bolstered by an array of official expansion packs), the amount of hardware available to play with is frustratingly slim. In many cases, opposing armies are equipped with identical vehicles which get a slightly different paint job at best. For anyone used to the myriad of variants and oddments available in Arma 2, Arma 3 can feel awfully disappointing.
Fortunately, this is alleviated to some extent by the strong mod community. It has long been the case that the best parts of the Arma games are the parts not developed by Bohemia Interactive themselves, and Arma 3 is most definitely continuing this 'tradition'. Nevertheless, I can't help but feel that the game could've done with a few months more time in the oven before full public release.

Speaking of the mod community, I think it's criminal that almost none of the best, near-indispensible mods from Arma 2 have been officially integrated. For a self-professed 'war simulator', Arma 3 is hugely lacking in basic features like being able to rest your weapon on surfaces (even with a visible bipod), or tow damaged vehicles.

For all its flaws, though, Arma 3 is still a blast to play. If you can find a decent group of like-minded gamers with access to a voice-over-net server, you're in for some of the best gaming you'll ever experience. Sure, you'll probably have to load up on mods to satisfy your need for variety. And sure, sometimes the game will crash spectacularly, or the physics engine will flip out and kill you for standing too close to a wall. But when you're standing on a hilltop, looking out over an enemy outpost with your squadmates while a CAS helicopter strafes an enemy APC and spots targets for a distant sniper team; when everything clicks together in the way that only Arma can manage, you'll be glad to have been along for the ride."

76561198019977288,107410,True,0.875654399394989014,"I don't know where to start with this but let's just try:

My first experience with ArmA was with the Operation Flashpoint Series and later on with ArmA 1 (Cold war Assault) and then ArmA 2 (+ all possible Add-Ons).
And i just have to say, that i freakin fell in love with this game (ArmA3) from the very begining.

Sure there were heaves of problems, bugs and shit going wrong at the beginning but i still bought this game as soon as it was availabe (Which should've been like early Alpha or so).

But to explain why i sank over propably 2000 hours of my life into this game:

-Versatility: With the workshop added and all the mod support the game offers, it's just incredible for how long you are able to find new stuff. New Maps, weapons, uniforms, AI-Units, vehicles, helicopers, tanks, etc. etc.

-Versitility: With the ZEUS Modul and the Ed3n Editor you are able to creato soooooo much stuff. You can create YOUR OWN scenarios, and the overview them and change them while playing with zeus. if you play with a few people and you keep changing the missio maker you never ever ever run out of ideas/scenarios to play.

-Versitilititititiy: I think we've bee here before... With the huge mod support theres other beefits aswell. If you are playing onlie you will be able to find all sorts of server. wether you like playing as a lone wolf and kill other players, play in a huge team vs. AI encampments/bases, or just get flipping rich with selling apples. there's something for everyone out there.

But i don't want to hail everythig into the sky here, so here's a few negatives, which imo you should kow before you buy this:

-This game is in NO regards something for people lookig for a run & gun game. It's a Mil Sim after all.
-With the milsim aspect comes the complication of finding key bindings for everything you want to be able to do. so be preapared to learn buttloads of them (Especially with TFAR and ace in play).
-The graphics may look BRILLIANT on a good rig but if you are on minimum specs prepare for some frame problems,
 especially on bigger servers (although i have to say BI optimized a lot with the last few updates)

But other then that i can really just recommend this game if you are into military shooters that own you huge piles of different stuff.

And since my ""N"" key is fucked, here are some Ns for you guys that made it this far: n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n
That should've made up for the missed ones.

76561198030752353,107410,True,0.973724424839019775,"Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that it‚Äôs developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But it‚Äôs even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. 

At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the game‚Äôs complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your ass depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. 

Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3‚Äôs two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as I‚Äôm stuck on one mission that I simply can‚Äôt seem to complete.)

However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves.

Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). I‚Äôm sure there are so many others that I haven‚Äôt even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game.

In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless.  

Purchase this game. Purchase it now. Thank me later.

76561198031889408,107410,True,0.958130419254302979,"Been playing ARMA for almost 10 years now. It‚Äôs grown alongside me, and has created some of the most memorable moments I‚Äôve ever experienced in a videogame. It‚Äôs one of those games which, when it finally ‚Äòclicks‚Äô with you, never quite leaves you. You always find yourself going back to it. It‚Äôs not a game which necessarily empowers you like DOOM or Wolfenstein, but the pay-off from successfully pulling off that mission, that flank, that firing solution, that landing, even that single shot, is unparalleled. 

I‚Äôll always remember the moody fog of the APEX Protocol co-op missions as me and my friend crawled through the jungle, silently taking out patrols hunting for us with flashlights dancing in the dark. I‚Äôll always remember finally Escaping from Tanoa after six hours with my mates ‚Äî it felt like a hiking trip by the end. I‚Äôll always remember staying prone in a ghillie suit as a whole platoon of Russians patrolled past my squad, just like in All Ghillied Up. No other game can recreate the thrill or complexity of these memories in an emergent and inherently personal manner. 

My friends and I, after ten years, have talked for hours about that one mission which went so wrong or that incredible shot one of us made across a whole valley, or just how much we associate some terrains like Sahrani or Stratis with our first years as teenagers back at school. ARMA, for me, is an experience equal in its thrills and frustrations as it is in its nostalgia ‚Äî you come to learn these towns, these fields, these roads and valleys and recall them each as affectionately as the other. Sure, things go wrong: a miscommunication is made, a helicopter crashes, the physics engine freaks out, or the server messes up, but most of the time, you‚Äôll laugh through it. 

ARMA is unlike any other game ‚Äî any other experience. I think this ramble has been quite open in displaying just how much it means to me, and how much it will continue to mean to me. I can assure you, if you give it a chance, it will quickly mean as much to you too."

[h1]*I recommend this particularly for its multiplayer.[/h1]

+ Extremely mod friendly; enjoys full support from the Steam Workshop
+ Visuals & environmental design, save for a few issues here and there (i.e. empty buildings), has largely aged well & looks fantastic
+ Employs a deeply challenging level of realism
+ Multiplayer is still very active; boasts a wonderful variety of gameplay & modded servers to choose from
+ Long, content-packed single player campaign; player choices do affect potential endings, as there are several
+ Time control is back from Arma 2; player can speed up the passage of time, which helps SIGNIFICANTLY to combat the monotony of walking/running very long distances between objectives
+ Enormous map/playable area
+ User-created scenarios & a very easy-to-use scenario creator
+ Boasts incredibly varied gameplay mechanics; from piloting/driving myriad vehicles & gunships, to underwater missions, & everything in-between
+ Map & squad mechanics are back; while they may feel clunky to use in a combat scenario, a little practice goes a long way & serves to open up a slew of options on the battlefield

- Sound design is very hit & miss; some weapons sound identical to others, & vehicle sound effects tend to sound strangely muted
- Dialogue is also hit & miss; while I found the voice-acting to be done largely well, some of the dialogue is a bit awful
- Soundtrack often felt cheesy or inappropriate
- Mission pacing often feels very uneven; I felt that it often leaned too far into the realm of the tedious in the interest of realism (shouldn't be a bad thing in theory, but for the pruposes of a video game, it can put players to sleep in some missions)
- The initial learning curve is considerable, & the tutorial felt inadequate overall; mechanics are amazing on paper, but take an inordinate amount of time to master

76561197965925721,107410,True,0.955902099609375,"This is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming, this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things. Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality. There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release.

One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s.

As we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon. We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols. Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower.

There I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower. I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position. But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed.

As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive.

Falling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command. I had done it. I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive.

That is what this game is about."

76561198007471493,107410,True,0.94609987735748291,"Where do I start with Arma 3...

 1st of all, have I played enough of this game? No, not in the slightest. My total playtime (see above) is pathetic in comparison to those around me. I see upwards of 2000, 3000, 4000 hours just looking at the reviews currently. At the time of writing this review, I sit on a measly 61 hours of gameplay, so I am in no way an expert of this game. 

 What I CAN  tell you is that there are moments in that 61 hours of gameplay that I will probably never forget. This game makes you feel things you won't feel in any other shooter. Call of Duty thrives on high adrenaline, rapid paced combat. Battlefield slows it down a bit, but maintains a good balance of action and spacing between engagements. 

 Arma 3 is a completely different ballpark. There is a LOT of spacing between engagements, which adds massive suspense and makes every firefight very, very meaningful. When combat initiates, there is definately adrenaline pumping action, but it's not fast. Combat is very slow, almost methodical (just like real life) but very, very... awesome. Some things that you'll see in an Arma firefight that you will not see anywhere else:
 - Engagements will be very long distance, often hundreds of meters away, especially if you're roaming the hills or open wilderness. Enemies may only be a fleck in your scope, on another hill entirely, several football fields away from you.
 - You often won't know where you're getting shot from if you're taken by surprise. You don't get any indicators that say ""Hey! someone to your left just shot you!"". Instead, you'll be forced to take cover and locate the enemy the old fashioned way: watching and listening.
 - If you get shot, you probably wont have time to react. One or two shots will kill you without much warning.
 - Teamplay is CRUCIAL. Medics, Anti-Tank, Heavy Gunners all have a part to play in their teams success. 
 - Communication on a whole other level. There is a radio/audio system in the game that is essential to a squad's success. Squad leaders will be vocal, squadees must be willing to take orders and communicate with their superioirs. Directions will not be called out like ""LEFT! RIGHT!"" but rather with compass bearings such as ""There's at least 3 of them at... 248""
 - Stand/Crouch/Prone is also at another level entirely. You can also hunch over, stand up super tall, sit down, lean on your side, bend your body left and right etc.. Manipulating these stances and using them to show as little of you as possible may be a key factor on whether you live or die
 - Every move you make has a pro and a con attached to it. Fire your weapon? Might kill someone, but you might also give your position away or get shot as you peak out of cover. Forget to look left? Arma teaches that wherever you don't look, there will be something that kills you.
 - NO HITMARKERS. You have to make your own call as to whether or not the guy you just shot is dead. If you make the wrong call, your squad may advance only for one of them to be shot by a (very much alive) enemy solider
 - Tanks and armored vehicles are terrifying. It's not like Battlefield where a tank shows up, everybody continues their daily routines and hopefully somebody with anti tank weaponry deals with the 15 ton chunk of metal. Armored vehicles are terrifyingly powerful with weapons foot soldiers can only dream of. A whole squad of 20 people will immediately hit the deck if one of them shpws up, hoping that their AT guys can do the job because...
  - You don't respawn back into the heat of battle. You reaspawn in a base in the middle of nowhere and you either have to take a helicopter to meet with your squad, or ""HALO jump"", which teleports you to an exaxct location but 6000 feet up in the sky, forcing you to have to use your parachute to land safely. HALO jumping back into combat is suicide. Big shiny glorified baloons make really, really good target practice. That also means...
  - If you lose that aforementioned anti-tank guy, you're hooped unless someone takes the risk and picks the launcher off his dead body. That is, unless the tank/armored car blows him up before he gets there. Then 20 people are stranded with very little to do, which means...
 - Every life counts.

 The combat is unreal. I remember we had to clear this city of enemies, entirely. It took us upwards of an hour, but  we checked every single building, room by room, until, In the center plaza, there he stood; the last man we had to kill. All the other building were checked, and I saw a head poking out behind this obstacle in the dead center of the city,

 ""I found him!"" I yell over the squad's radio, ""Central Garden, straight north"" I notice he pokes his head around the corner. My assault rifle was depleted.

 I knew I should have packed more flipping ammo.
 
 So I pull out my pistol. Fire, miss, fire, miss, rinse andrepeat. I empty my whole clip and the man is not dead. So I reload, and just start Terminator walking my way towards this guy. Firing every round I have. The guy doesn't poke his head out anymore. One clip exhausted, then another. And another. This guy will not die. I least I'm supressing him. 

 Then he pops around, shoots me once. Dead.

 My squad catches up ""What the hell was all that shooting?!"" the commander expresses.
 
 They grenade him. Dead.

 Wish I'd have thought of that sooner. 

 The medic gives me a nice repair. I borrow some mags off of him. We get on the chopper, talking about how wicked that mission was. We get a new one, something about planting a bomb somewhere.

 At this point the squad has bonded. We knew eachothers names, at least. We just kept talking, getting closer to the LZ, mocking the pilot for driving too low to the ground. We land and immediately, the chopper comes under fire.

 ""RUN! SPREAD OUT!""

 The heli blows up before it can leave. We all die in a blaze of glory.

 And I left the game after that.

 I cannot recommend this game enough."
76561198176296555,107410,True,0.944918155670166016,"I spent several years in the army and I gotta say this game is spot on with the training and atmosphere the military provides. I love how difficult this game is, and I love all of the different features the game provides. It is NOT easy to hit a target with an assault rifle from 300 yards in real life, and this game seems to match that same difficulty. Fatigue is a real thing and it seriously hinders your accuracy in real life...Arma 3 makes you stop and catch your breath if you run too far or carry too much gear, or you will have a hard time hitting your target. Enemies are not stupid and they have great vision. I was engaged by two enemies from about 200 yards away and they were using bushes for cover as well as 3-5 second rushes when moving. The AI is more advanced than the average taliban are in real life. haha :p Given my love for the military and for videogames, this one is definitely one of my favorites of all time :D"
76561198130981093,107410,True,0.943312287330627441,"I'm not into arma anymore, but as you can probably tell from the amount of hours I've spent paying this game; I've had an incredible time.

Most of the hours clocked into this game have been spent on roleplay servers. They were so fun back in the day..people weren't too serious, and neither too silly. It was very balanced, very fun. Very replayable.

But arma ain't all about roleplay, so let's talk about other things:

I'll start with combat mechanics, obviously - as the game is all about fighting lol. 
The combat is ABSOLUTELY FLIPPING GREAT! You got things like bullet drop which keeps you on your game, and other things such as weapons becoming less effective as the bullet travels mid-air..you also have very aweosme-looking postures which you can adopt; from laying prone, to sitting on your bum, to crouching, leaning side-to-side, and all dat weird jazz.

It's also very realistic in that, you can only take 1-5 shots before you die pending on which weapon is used against you and what kind of protective gear you have equipped. This means that you have to be VERY careful in-game, otherwise you might just get shot in the head and die. Personally, I enjoy such hardcore mechanics.
Another hardcore mechanic is how damage taken is based on where you are hit on your body. So if you've been shot in the head, you're likely to take a hell of a lot of damage, and this is where armour becomes a huge importance; without armour, you are as vulnerable as a mouse surrounded by a horde of cats. I shouldn't even need to stress how much you need armour! You can go light, or heavy - your choice. The amount you wear does affect movement speed though, so do be careful of that. It also affects how badass you look; I generally like to go light so I look like a badass mofo who is totally capable of destroying anyone who crosses my path lol. Not only that, but your appearance can also affect how easily an enemy can spot you. So if you have a huge bag on your back, and lightly coloured clothes- you can be sure people will spot you with ease.

So yeah. Useful information there, I know. But I am most certainly not done! We have to talk about the tanks, and the awesome vehicles that can totally blow ur balls off!

In arma, there are about 20 different ground vehicles, all unique in both appearance and purpose. You have a few anti-vehicle tanks, a few anti-people tanks, and a few artillery and anti-air tanks. Personally, I love the artillery....they're like mini nukes lol. 

You also have APPACHI ATTACK HELICTOPERS! I mean who doesn't like that!? And some awesome looking submarines and attack planes..and boats :):)
AND CARS WITH MOUNTED TURRETS ON!

Yeah, long-story-short -- arma has tons of vehicles, all awesome in both appearance and nature. Very useful for committing mass-genocide on dem pesky capitalist NATO forces....mmmm, satisfactory

Also sorry for not listing their names. I no good wit dat :(:(

Arma also has lots of game modes to choose from, so you're not restricted to just playing one gamemode and getting bored after an hour. I believe I've already listed one already; roleplay. Others include but are not limited to(due to custom game modes etc); TDM, KOH, KTF, PLAYER VS AI(forgot the official classification, sorry), 5v5 COMPETITIVE MATCHES (like that csgo competitive game mode), custom zombie modes, and survival modes. There are also singleplayer game modes which you can host, such as Zeus or custom Addons which allow for various different gameplay experiences; which brings me to my next topic...

There are loads of mods available on the steam workshop! From halo mods, to Star Wars, to enhanced combat system and mechanic mods, xcom mods, and various others which add more vehicles, factions, armour/clothing, more ai, etc...

The settings menus are also vast and fleshed out in arma, so you can rest assured that you'll be able to configure almost anything you want. 
The game also doesn't require a very high-tier computer to function nominaly, so lag shouldn't really be a problem; especially if you tune down the graphics via the settings menus a bit.

This'll be the last topic within this review; multiplayer.
Multiplayer is obviously a huge part of the game, as I've briefly mentioned previously(with the game modes). This game is almost solely multiplayer-based, but singleplayer is a thing and can be fun, so don't feel restricted. This game being focused mainly on multiplayer is obviously good for playing with friends. You can have much fun playing with friends online in this game, much fun indeed. Lag can be a problem though, so make sure you have a decent internet connection and don't be disappointed if you can't play with a friend based half way across the world from you :) but personally I feel the devs have really improved connectibility over the passed years in terms of multiplayer. Id say it's currently at its peak.

Check this game out. It's relatively cheap for its value, so I advise such.

Apologies if I've missed some flavourful features or mechanics. I'll definitely be sure to edit this review if anyone comes in screaming at me about how I didn't include ""this and that and this and that and this and that"" lol.

We're on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back. I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing.

     Now that I am at almost 730 hours played at the time of this review's initial publication I thought it was time for me to review my favorite game. This is not going to be a typical review where they say something along the lines of ""swam in the air, 79 out of 10 would be break laws of physics again,"" although that has happened to me and it was hilarious. This is going to be an in depth and honest review of Arma 3.

First though, here is some context.

      When Arma 3 first came out in 2013 I was so excited because I had been watching Arma 2 for so long and I was really hyped on the Arma 3 trailers, not that I actually had a good enough computer to play either one of them of course, so I waited until I finally did. I waited for 3 1/2 years watching YouTube videos and wishing that I could have Arma 3, It was sheer torment. All the cool things that people did just made the situation worse: every valiant last stand against zombies that saved the city, every stealth mission that crippled the enemy, and every close air support gun run that saved a convoy that was under threat just made me want Arma 3 more. So, when I finally had a computer that was good enough to play games on it one of the first games that I got was Arma 3.

       Arma 3 was nothing like I had expected it to be, it was better. An entire virtual sandbox for me to do anything I wanted, go anywhere I wanted, and play any way I wanted. It was not like a ""sophisticated Battlefield"" or a ""Call of Duty on steroids"" like I was expecting it to be, or how I was told it was. Arma 3 is just better. Those descriptions don't even remotely do the game justice. The modding support is astounding to say the least, like I said earlier, zombies. The maps are gorgeous, the weapons are wonderfully modeled, and you have a fully customizable character from the face, to the clothes, to the voice. Arma 3 is more than meets the eye, sure it‚Äôs beautiful, but it also has a great deal of depth behind that gorgeous high polygon count tree, and highly reflective water, and I love it to death for it.

       Arma 3 is in some ways the next logical step for somebody who is into the first person shooter genre, you probably don't know what they say about the game but here it is anyway. ""Children play Call of Duty, boys play Battlefield, men play Arma."" I feel like this statement is true, at least on some levels. The Arma series just feels mature to me, and much more refined than Call of Duty or Battlefield as well. They are not games where you can easily be a""Super Duper MACV Recon SOG SEAL Delta Force Green Beret CIA Operator,"" go ""gunz blazin,"" and kill ""all dem dudes over dere."" Although that sometimes works much to my own surprise and amusement. Arma 3 requires at least some modicum of strategy, or my personal favorite, a great big helping of luck to win, or even be good at in some cases, and I think that is good thing, Arma demands that people invest time into.

       Arma 3 has a large amount of multiplayer content that somebody can enjoy, you can play on a life server and rise through the ranks to become whoever you want to be, whether you want to be are a brutal crime lord, or the mayor of the town. The king of the hill servers bring a nice challenge to Arma 3 where you can fight in and against, in a perfect world, a well organized group of players who are trying very diligently to accomplish their objectives in Arma 3's virtual world. I loved Arma so much that I decided to found a unit which can be found here: join.crabsunion.com

The choice really is up to you on what you want to do in the game, and the built in mission maker with the option to add a ""Zeus"" for mission changes on the fly is always a great option. It is fun to play God for a while, and terrorize your friends.

       The singleplayer content of Arma 3 is quite good, I am very much enjoying the new ""Stepping Stone"" campaign, where NATO forces are trying to seize the picturesque island of Malden in an attempt to attain and maintain aerial dominance over the critically important Strait of Gibraltar.The ""Apex Protocol Campaign"" is very well made in my opinion with several missions that make you feel like you really are a ""Super Duper MACV Recon SOG SEAL Delta Force Green Beret CIA Operator."" Another great thing about the Apex Protocol campaign is that it gives you the option of playing it with friends if you so choose, something I wish the other campaigns did as well.

       Many people say that Arma 3 has a steep learning curve and I disagree. You pick up new things very quickly in Arma 3, or at least I do. Arma 3 just has so much to learn that many people think that it is a very difficult game to play when it is not. Almost every time I play Arma 3 I learn something new about the game or how to play it more effectively. It does not matter whether this is some knowledge about how to use Zeus or make mission more effectively, if it is some new tactic for clearing houses, or even if it is a technique on how to get more stable frame rate. Even with my amount of play time, and the amount of videos I have watched on Arma 3, I am still learning new things constantly. I believe that fact alone sets Arma 3 apart from other games.

       Arma 3 is a somewhat underappreciated treasure in the gaming world with endless content and unlimited scenarios to explore and it deserves more publicity than it is getting. I hope that this review was helpful to you and informative as well. Furthermore I hope that it didn‚Äôt bore you to death too much. Anyways, you have a great day now."

Great game for the more serious war gamer, not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from Call of Duty series which I consider more for the younger gamers anyway.

Arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games, similar to Battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using. You will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10-20 minutes in a single location (sometimes longer, I personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward.

You will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance.

You can not respawn as quickly as you can in CoD if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic.

The graphics are great, the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to.

I recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible (unless doing paintballing or airgunning), and if you do buy the game - I recommend completing the whole VR Tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the Campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game."

August 20th 2019. I was in a Squad of 7 men. I had the duty of a combat life saver. We had to fly oversea's on a Helicopter. I couldn't tell if my pilot was drunk or my dial up internet was making the helicopter do acrobatics but it was intense. About 5 minutes of flying we touch down safely, getting out as my ears immediately explode from my sound mod making the helicopter 5000x louder. It was awesome. We continue down the road for another 200m when a sniper from the treeline blows off one of my boys heads. We all scramble for cover behind the hill. My boy and I had to kill the MMG who were suppressing our men. We take a flank to the left in hopes of gunning this asshole down. Because the AI are fucking superman, me and my boy were immediately spotted and suppressed by sniper fire behind a rock. He gets hit in the chest which caused a velocity wound and other medical wounds. I sew him up like the god I am and we continue down the hill under all sorts of fire. I take a bullet to my arm and leg, making me as slow as a 60 year old asthmatic hippo with 3 legs. I stitch up my wounds and began limping to some more cover. I fix my leg somehow and im mobile again, pushing into the objective we were supposed to take an hour ago. Our NATO squad successfully raided the base. Only 2 men were killed and all CSAT have been eliminated.

Or so we thought.

The man on the radio sounds like his balls dropped off Mount Everest. He tells us CSAT reinforcements will be arriving shortly. I was unprepared with only 3 mags of ammunition and only a few medical bandages and morphine left. After a few minutes of respite, a shot is echoed from the hills and another firefight takes place again. These assholes now have armored cars with .50 guns on them. 4 of our men are killed within seconds. Thankfully i brought AT rockets with me and I take out the armored car. It explodes in a fiery mess, leaving that area scorched. My boy and I take cover behind a shitty jeep as more and more bullets fly over our heads. He gets hit in the chest 2 times and in the leg 3. I'm out of ammunition in both weapons and I am forced to drag him behind a tree. I take a hit to my chest and start to bleed out. Medical supplies are running thin. 

A few minutes passed and the CSAT have stopped firing. They probably thought we all died. I failed to medic my friend as his cold, dead body lay in the grass. I scavenge off my dead teammates for ammo, leaving my aim in the garbage due to the multiple wounds to the arms. Just when I thought all was over, a NATO chopper has came to evacuate me. I have a blood pressure of the exact definition of trash, my heart rate is 50 and my screen is black and white. I'm limping up a hill while taking multiple shots from the CSAT hiding in the thick brush. I am able to get into the chopper and escape as the last man in my squad to live. 

From that day on, I have diagnosed myself with PTSD. Only play if your balls are made of titanium."

76561198123083438,107410,True,0.926028549671173096,"For this review I'm going to open with a price breakdown, because at the end of the day when you're looking at getting a game you're trying to figure out whether or not it's worth it.

[h1]Price Breakdown[/h1]
Full price of the game and all DLC without deals or bundles $200.25

With my 4,000 hours of gameplay that equates to
 $0.0502375 an hour of playtime (Or about 5 cents)
 $1.2057 a day of playtime

Days between 1 August 2016 (When I bought it) and 12 March 2020 (date of this review)
That's 1,319 days or 31,656 hours
 $0.00632581501137225170583775587566‚Ä¨ an hour (or about half a cent)
 $0.15181956027293404094010614101592 a day (Or about 15 cents)


Arma is a near future military sandbox experience that gives players access to play how they want, whether they want to be infantry, tank operators, war journalists, helicopter pilots, jet pilots, boat captains, divers. Arma has something to suit any players wants.

[h1]Are the DLCs worth it?[/h1]
So when we're looking at value it is well worth it. I often run into people going on in lobbies about how Arma is always bringing out DLCs that cost way too much for what they are and that Bohemia is just a moneyhungering company, but when you break it down the level of detail they bring to the table and the time you spend on the content is unparalleled in terms of replayability. Aside from the singleplayer campaigns and the maps introduced in DLCs all of the content is actually free to use whether you own the DLC or not, the only downside is that if you do use something that you don't own the DLC for then a watermark will show up on the side of your screen for a few seconds every five to ten minutes or so.

It seems that in many peoples eyes the most cardinal sins are the Contact DLC and Laws of War DLC. But I only ever hear complaints about them from people that when I get into debates with them they say 'Oh, I forgot Arma had a singleplayer."" or ""Pfffft, no one plays the singleplayer."" But this last statement couldn't be more wrong. In fact in terms of parts of this game that shine, the singleplayer campaigns and missions are a big part of that.

[h1]Singleplayer[/h1]
The way the tutorial seemlessly blends into the story of the larger campaign, to the political turmoil you find yourself being embroiled in, to the intrigue of the moral dilemmas you find yourself asking at the end of the Laws of War campaign. These stories are memorable! If you ever dip your hands in the Zeus gamemode (the veritable Dungeons and Dragons of the Armaverse) you'll often find yourself recreating some of those memorable experiences for other players, such as the uneasy downtime and that suspenseful few moments before a major gunfight.

[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]
If singleplayer isn't your thing then the multiplayer will keep you coming back again and again, whether you want to have a PVP killfest in King of the Hill, a PVE mission based gamemode in Invade and Annex or Antistasi, the aforementioned Zeus gamemode, a roleplay experience in ArmaLife servers, or a hardcore military simulation. Arma has it all. When it comes to the multiplayer, most of my most enjoyable moments have been the downtime in between missions, whether chilling at the base or traveling to the area of operations. Arma multiplayer is a social experience at heart and that's where the multiplayer experience really shines in my eyes. I have met many people over the years that I am still good friends with to this day, and I have Arma to thank for that. We have had good times together and even better stories to tell. When I was first playing this game I didn't have a microphone so I had to type everything I wanted to get across, because of that I inadvertently learnt touch typing, which is pretty strange to say when someone asks you how you learnt to touch type. The official servers can become quite chaotic, but if you find a nice server a community is hosting then that can be like a second home, even with some of the chaotic people in the official servers the community as a whole is the most welcoming community I've come across in a game.

[h1]Community[/h1]
Touching on the community, Arma has a strong and committed modding and content creation community, mainly due to the passion of the users and the easy to use modding and mission creation tools, such as the 3DEN editor, a 3d mission maker contained within the game itself which harkens back to the golden age of Real Time Strategy games, such as Age of Empires. So if what you want to do isn't quite in the game, you're sure to find a mod or a mission that allows you to do that and if you can't there is an abundance of information on how to make it yourself. And with the easeability of sharing modlists, it's easy to bundle all of the mods you need to make the experience you want to play and then share the list with your mates so that you can all play together.

[h1]Is Arma The Game For You?[/h1]
All in all there is a lot of downtime in this game, so if you're all about instant gratification, killstreaks and being the best of the best then this game probably isn't for you. Arma is a team game and a lot of the game is spent walking, travelling or planning which gives you a lot of time to get to know your team. So if you're not into that then this might not be the game for you when it comes to the multiplayer. If you're looking for a game that is a million different games however, Arma is for you. Because every experience is different and with mods it can even be an entirely different game, for an example just look at DayZ or PlayersUnknownBattlegrounds which both started their lives as mods on Arma.

Arma 3, best 4,000 I've spent in a game ever."
76561198097852352,107410,True,0.925913095474243164,"After putting in over 3500 hours, I have seen the good, the bad, and the downright ugly that ARMA III has to offer. With that being said, I offer my review. It will be a bit long, but after this much time in game, there is a lot to discuss. 

First off, the campaign for single player is ok, but not great. You will be able to find other games with better campaign story modes than ARMA III as the main focus is put on the Multiplayer aspect. However, the campaign and story does prove challenging and the story is solid enough to keep you entertained and engaged. 

Secondly, The DLC content is hit or miss. 

GOOD DLC!
-Tanks add several new tanks into the game and make putting a AP round through your enemy a joy!
-Jets add several new jets to wreak havoc with! It also adds a aircraft carrier!
-Marksman adds some of the best sniper rifles in the game period! Also adds several ghillie suits and scopes. 

Decent DLC.
-Helicopters adds two helis to the game. Mostly for heavy lifting. 
-APEX adds an Island called Tanoa. A dozen weapons and gear. A few vehicles and a few VTOL aircraft. 

Bad DLC!
-Karts. Go-karts on a battlefield. Is this a joke?
-Laws of War. A single player mini campaign for a multiplayer focused game.  Not worth your money.
- Tac-Ops. Again, another single player mini campaign in a multiplayer focused game. Not worth your money.

Third on the list in multiplayer. The true fun to be had with ARMA III is through the multiplayer. There are 1000's of servers all with different options to chose from fitting nearly every type and style of game play. Zombies, they got it. Not into Zombies? No problem. Co-op, yep! Role play, check! Survival, you bet! PvP for those that like to kill others and PvE for the more casual crowd can be found.

Fourth. The community of players found in ARMA III are some of the best I have seen. They are often found to be helpful and willing to lend a hand to newer players and also to veterans in need of assistance. With that being said, you will however run into the occasional troublemaker, rule breaker, or very rarely a hacker. Most of them are dealt with swiftly by the server admins. Then, also,  there is those few players who have little time to read the server rules and blindly run off into the battlefield annoying players by doing things they shouldn't. When corrected by others, they will usually reply "" I didn't know the rules. "" A word of advice. When entering a server, read the rules or simply ask in chat and other players will usually be happy to explain them. 

Fifth, the graphics. For a game that is over 5 years old, the graphics are good. Not great mind you, but good to say the least. 

Sixth, the game play. ARMA III focuses on two things. Realistic militarised game play and multiplayer action via servers. Most of the servers run mods created by people like you and me. Some are about survival and will have you scrounging the map for supplies and gear. Some are about playing team death-match. Some are co-op missions. They can be very fun and can add a lot of vehicles, maps, gear, aircraft, weapons, scenarios, and more to the game. However, no one is prefect and you will find yourself dead periodically after simply opening a door, walking down stairs, entering a vehicle, exiting a vehicle, etc. The point is, expect the unexpected. While this does not happen all the time, you most definitely will encounter a few bugs and glitches from time to time. The most common and frustrating is the sudden vanishing of vehicles left at your base. ARMA loves to eat vehicles for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Also, it will eat your gear, weapons, base, and well....pretty much anything.  So don't get too attached to your stuff. As a server admin for several different servers, I have spent entire days replacing lost items. However, do not expect all admins to be as accommodating as losing items in ARMA is all part of the game.

In all, ARMA III can be a very fun game to play. It's strength comes from the almost limitless ways the game can be played on the 1000's of available servers. After all this time, I still find myself spending the weekends running missions on several servers. In the end, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes realistic military style games."

311 days ago i was Developer banned from Arma 3. The day before i received this ban i had decided to download arma after months away from it. I downloaded the game, it remembered all my mods, downloaded them then i fired the game up.

Do you lads feel out of sorts some times and you sit looking at you vast steam library wondering what to play. Its kinda like choosing a film on Netflix, before you know it times up and you cant be bothered. It was like that. I sat in the in game menu for one minute (screen shot to prove it) before deciding not to play. I exited the game, steam and shut down my PC. 

The following day i decided i was going to fully get back into it. I loaded up my computer. Steam automatically opened but this time with a message. You have been banned from the following games (ARMA 3).

It stated i was banned by the developer. I immediately thought why the hell was i banned. I contacted BI within ten minutes. The response was the same as it remains today. 'we do not deal with bans, battleye do. Please contact battleye if you need support with a ban.' 

BUT YOU DO DEAL WITH BANS - THIS IS A DEV BAN NOT A BE BAN????

I spent the last 10 months contacting BE who eventually responded to tell me that they did not ban me nor did they find anything on my PC that was suspicious to them at the time of my ban. They informed my my logs were 'spotless'

I swung my attention back around to BI. I contacted them the other day. A chap called Dominik responded saying the ban was a battleye ban not a DEV ban.  I have since sent him images of my ban stating it was a DEV ban, steams explanation of a DEV BAN which states a developer informs valve of an account that is suspicious and valve ban them. I have sent images of my conversation with BE and proof that in the two weeks before my ban i had one minute of game time which was spent in the menu. 

The emails have fallen of deaf ears.....No response from Dominik. 

I am absolutely heart broken that from the past 10 months i have been unable to play with my friends and it looks like this situation is not going to change. I am disgusted as the lack of acknowledgement and willingness to support and resolve this from BI. 

I have so many fond memories in Arma 2, OH & 3 but it looks like this is the end of the road for me. I will miss the random chats in game, the communities i was part of and the battles of the field.

76561198061912275,107410,True,0.910561800003051758,"Arma 3 is like that long-term girlfriend/boyfriend you date where, at the honeymoon phase, you are smitten and are like ""wow, this is a 10/10 unique experience."" However, as the months turn to years and time rolls on, you start to realize there are shinier, prettier experiences out there- better looks, sexier moves, more stable, but you stick with it. You realize you're really with a solid 7/10, but **** is it fun. There are things he/she can do that no one else can, and well, despite deviations time to time to fantasize about other experiences, and several on-again/off-again times spent dabbling in those fantasies, you find yourself coming back to him/her. You find yourself truly happy...even after the worst (and unstable) times. Come to think of it, maybe this isn't a healthy relationship, but at the end of the day, it's a **** fun one.

Arma is an unstable, buggy ride and a bit overwhelming on first impressions, but it's an experience that you don't get in any other sandbox game or military shooter. The community is really what drives this game. It's a quasi-sim/quasi-arcade experience that can be tailored to the community/user's need given a little time spent learning how it all works. The developers do a decent job of providing documentation to understand how content creation and mission editing functions, and the community fills (and exceeds) the areas unfulfilled and self-imagined. There are few communities as diverse and robust as Arma's. In one night's events, you can go from playing a modern-day military sim night with your homies, to WWII, Vietnam, then Star Wars, Halo, Starship Troopers, Aliens, to the bloody revolutionary war and more. In short, Arma should be judged more as a sandbox & framework for community addons than a game on its own, and one that over the last 6 years developed into being highly accessible to the average user without even needing to touch a text editor or understand how it works to get custom games going through its implementation of a ""Dungeon Master"" style mission builder called ""Zeus."" Arma's experience varies greatly depending on your level of tolerance for troubleshooting and patience with searching/installing addons. 

This is best experienced by being dragged in by a community of friends... really it's kind of Stockholm Syndrome that kept me in it to start, and the incredible, fun, sometimes frustrating, and hilarious experiences made along the way is something no other game has offered and keeps me coming back. Give it a go, or watch some communities stream their experiences and see for yourself."

76561197979139992,107410,True,0.908434510231018066,"Well after playing this game for a few hours I thought it was about time to write a review.

I struggle to think of many games past or present that manage to do what Arma 3 does. Before the impending praise I'm about to give this game I will say 2 things. 

First, there will be bugs. Not the Starship Troopers kind... Well actually you can kill bugs as a Starship Trooper but I'm talking glitches, rubber banding, inventory issues, layer upon layer of mods causing compatibility issues and the list goes on. You simply have to embrace these problems and make them part of the enemy which you have to overcome! If you are easily put off by the above, Arma isnt for you, in fact the way games are pushed out these days a don't think many games would be for you.

Second, so far I have spent ¬£150 on this game (not including money spent on my own private server endeavours and donations to other public server communities) which sounds and is slightly ridiculous HOWEVER I have spent over 6000 hours on this game which is more than the rest of my steam library combined so as a time spent versus money paid its the cheapest game I've ever bought. All I say to anyone who somehow doesn't own it yet is wait for a Steam super sale and buy everything in one nice discount and your laughing!

The above remain the only 2 reasons I would not recommend this game, price Inc all dlc and the constant battle with bugs etc. All that aside Arma 3 is simply one of the best things you can buy for your PC. From the seemingly infinite Steam Workshop content to the fact that you can do anything from Milsim team based combat to simple PvP to cooperative missions to RPG style game modes to racing mods and a small off shoot you may have heard of called DayZ (Arma 2 mod but ya know what I'm getting at) it really does tick every box. There is a huge learning curve in the form of keybindings. It takes time just finding the right section to rebind keys but once you are comfortable I find the control of your character, chopper, jet, quad bike, humvee, tank, golf caddy etc quite intuitive. No other game gives you as many stances to be in. You can literally find a stance which gives you line of sight through a small hole in a wall at any angle. There are basic and advanced settings for flying so you can feel like a pro or take it easy with simplified physics and controls.

One final word... Community! As with all games you are bound to find trolls and people too competitive to remember what manners are, however on the whole Arma has a great community of players. I play 90% coop missions these days and it is just a breath of fresh air to be playing multiplayer on such a grand scale without this furious and frantic atmosphere which is so prominent in most multilayer games these days. After the demise of the Battlefield franchise after BC2 and BF3 I really needed a game to fill my need for military shooters and Arma 3 came to my rescue.

Rather than go on and on, all I will end on saying is that this game is more like a template for you to then decide what you actually want to spend your time doing. If you are on the fence, browse the workshop and see the sheer amount of 5 star community made content from overhaul mods to subtle quality of life mods. You could spend 6000 hours just playing all the single player campaigns made by other users."

76561198064868476,107410,True,0.905702114105224609,"This is quite possibly the most emotional shooter I've ever played, and it's not because of the campaign. 

Crowd around, children, it's story time.

One day, not so long ago, my squad had just destroyed an anti-air battery. Our pilot landed, and the rest of the squad boarded one by one. I was about to get in when the rockets started flying.

The chopper lifted off, with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes. Unwilling to die before then, I rushed to the nearest cover, a small house by a narrow road. I entered to find a ten year-old player who had also been left behind. He explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his ""clan"".

I politely declined, explaining that my own squad was inbound. As I finished, a Ghost Hawk flew over the horizon. My squad had arrived.

This noble child soldier and I were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting. The sniper screamed as a 6.5 mm cartridge entered his leg. His shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as I climbed in the transport.

My new friend was dead.

10/10, would experience survivor guilt again."

Grossly outdated graphics engine, poorly optimised, it remains the closest game you can ever play to the real thing. During its heyday, milsim communities and modders made this more of an experience than some simple combat simulator - I was able to don exactly the same equipment, uniform and loadouts that I served with while in the army.
NOT worth it if you're playing vanilla arma - terrifying and immersive if you use mods.
You can eat, climb walls, abseil, drink, splint fractures, dress burns, dig foxholes, engage in melee, interrogate, be suppressed and find yourself in a house being breached and cleared by the enemy.
Unless it's vanilla...

76561197971414496,107410,True,0.896043360233306885,"Arma 3 is a tricky game to review, but here‚Äôs me trying it anyway.

The reason why this game is so hard to review lies in the sheer size of the game and the variety of things it may or may not offer for the player.

I take Arma 3 for what it is first and foremost: a platform. What you get is a good looking game with a solid (would be great, but you have to do some optimization to boost your performance) engine, two amazing maps (Stratis and Altis, which is probably the most impressive map I‚Äôve seen in any open world-ish game) and the prospect of near endless new content from the community.

What you don‚Äôt get is an easy to get into mil-shooter with CoD sized maps and a quick pace. If you‚Äôre in for uncomplicated, fast paced PvP gameplay, you should probably look elsewhere. If you‚Äôre sick of that, however, Arma 3 might be just your thing. 

The strength of the Arma series is freedom (**** yeah). You are free to mod the game into almost anything you want, create any type of mission and make your very own gameplay experience. You have to invest some time into the game, but once you got into it, the opportunities are endless.

Want to play huge adversial or coop maps with a hundred players or more?  Arma is just your thing and there are big communities (in many different languages) that will help you find that epic experience.

Want to play singe player? Well, if you expect strong single player content with interesting characters and storyline and so on, then Arma 3 isn‚Äôt the game you‚Äôre looking for.  Or is it? Right now Bohemia delivered one part of a three part campaign ‚Äì those missions are challenging, offer a solid variety of infantry gameplay but don‚Äôt expect a good story or interesting characters. But as mentioned before ‚Äì the huge amount of community made missions and mods offer hours and hours of playtime.

Personally I prefer small cooperative missions to play with friends. Already the steam workshop has countless missions for 2-5 players. 

So, should you buy Arma 3? Well, I‚Äôd certainly recommend it, if any of the things I mentioned above sounds fun to you. It is to say though, that this game is not something that everyone might like, so stay away from it if you are not willing to invest some time into it.

I hope that this review helped some people to decide whether or not they should by Arma 3. Please note that I‚Äôm not a native English speaker, so the language used in this review might seem a little odd for some."

As I do so, the developer's splash screen flashes on the screen, followed by the warm  welcome of the ARMA III logo and subsequent main menu screen. In this moment, I feel happy and fulfilled. The events of the real world bear no importance to me as I undertake the task of deciding what I'm going to get myself into today. Shall it be Altis life antics? Do I recreate the Osama Bin Laden raid with my friends? Should I attempt to put myself into the shoes of a Marine in the middle of the Tet Offensive of late 1968?

[b] Welcome to Arma 3: The Big One [/b]

If you didn't just start PC gaming an hour ago, you've probably heard of Arma 3. Every time someone says the names Call of Duty, Battlefield, Squad, Red Orchestra, Verdun, or any other shooter title out there, they do so in hushed tones and with their hands over their mouths for fear of the inevitable tongue-lashing they're about to receive from an Arma fan.
Fans of the Arma series are fiercly loyal and totally uncompromising. I have little doubt you've heard the following phrases:

[list]
[*]""If you want [i] realism, [/i] you should play Arma.""
[*]""Only casuals play. . . .""
[*]""Arma 3 is way better because . . . .  and  . . . . ""
[/list]

It's annoying and inarguably elitist but, in their defense, also mostly true. Arma 3 is not for someone who is looking for a casual shooter experience. Arma 3 is for those of us that want to camp out in the trees, waiting for the three guys you saw 30 minutes before, and hoping you can pull of a successful ambush quickly, quietly, and without getting hit. Then, walking for another 30 minutes to link up with another squad, grab some vehicles, and truck a few kilometers out to set up a new FOB. You can expect to go upwards of 3 hours without firing a shot on certain servers.

Which brings me to my next point. . . 

[b] The Game Within a Game Within a Game Within a Game. . . . [/b]

One of A3's major selling points is it's massive, active, dedicated, and diverse community of modders. Arma 3 has a great single player campaign and a few nice King of the Hill and Wasteland servers that you will want to visit occasionally, but Arma gets particularly interesting when you go mod shopping. 

in the mood to lose track of 30 hours while you're dodging police officers and rival gangs as you fight to expand your criminal empire across Altis and/or Tanoa?
Asylum 'Life' servers are a personal favorite of mine. Complete with a living, player-driven economy, impactful politics between gangs and a police force trying to keep control of the island as these gangs throw lead and shade at one another in a constant struggle for turf. If that sounds familiar to you, make no mistake, GTA V doesn't come close to touching the complexity of Life servers.

There are mods for different eras of warfare, gamemodes for about anything you can imagine, and you can find most of them on Steam Workshop, making it easy to access and giving you infinite playtime. You literally cannot run out of things to do because there is [i] always [/i] more content.

I could honestly write about Arma all evening but I'll leave you with a few pros and cons and then I'll wrap things up for you.

[b] PROS: [/b]
[list]
[*]Infinite play value, you can never run out of content
[*]satisfying and memorable moments come to those with patience
[*]game modes for almost everything thanks to the modding community
[*]great graphics for excellent immersion
[*]Endless selection of weapons, vehicles, gear, etc.
[*]Shed your 'casual' title and pick up the mark of 'master' gamer
[/list]

[b] CONS: [/b]
[list]
[*]Arma 3 is not well optimized and is very CPU intensive. Still perfectly playable at 30fps though you will need a high end i7 if you expect to get anywhere near 60fps on most multiplayer servers. AMD users be warned.
[*]Seriously not for casual gamers. I cannot stress this enough. It can take hours to accomplish simple goals depending on your game mode. Highly satisfying when things come together, though.
[*]Expect to move slowly while learning controls. Arma 3 is a game that uses just about [i] all [/i] of your keyboard and it will take you a while to master.

[b] But Should I Buy It? [/b]

I can't recommend this game enough. But if you're a die-hard Call of Duty fan but you still pick up this title, you're in for a rude awakening. Casual gamers be warned."

Meh.. After 3099 hours and 15000 deaths later it's still a game you will return back to.
Thumbsup all the way."
76561198026803446,107410,True,0.888425886631011963,Just buy it. Look at how many hours I have in this game. It's the best money you'll ever spend. It is all things to all gamers.
76561197995591955,107410,True,0.88792949914932251,"Can't tell you if you should buy it or not, but I can tell you this.
You will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isn't there and lack of content if you're not satisfied with what you have. 
But when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, it's something magical you just can't find in any other game.

Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly.
Arma is a game which you can never called finished. There will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations. 

Hope I expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :)

If you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem!

I'll give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, I've used hundreds of hours on Arma 3 that I would never take back.

That being said, there's a reason why so many players in the review section have 1000+ hours in spite of this. You will simply will not find a game like this anywhere else. 

Now, some people don't care much for the realism, and prefer action-movie esque shooters. That's fine. However, this game shines at gritty realistic firefights. There's nothing glorious about shouting contact reports into the radio, bounding cover to cover, and hoping the next round doesn't have your name on it, but when you're finally back on the bird with your buddies headed home, and you finally feel the sense of relief wash over you.

76561198229080732,107410,True,0.882169544696807861,"Had this game for over 2 years now, and over 4000 hours played.

I have to admit, if you decide to start getting in depth with this game, it will be hard to stop depenending in which gamemode you play on. Life servers =Your done. Once you start progressing from rank to rank you'd never want to stop. This game is amazing, but very addictive to the point where someone like me has 4k hours on it."
76561198049422365,107410,True,0.882125139236450195,"Being an avid ArmA 2 Wasteland/DayZ player back in the day (about 1.5 years ago), I relished the thought of a new ArmA coming out. ArmA 2 was practically uknown until it's popularity was increased by DayZ. I found it interesting to jump into a BI (Bohemia Interactive) title that already had a steady fan-base behind it. Having been about a year since I purchased this game (launch) and over 100 hours of solid gameplay I feel that I can finally write a review that encompasses many of the aspects I have experienced within this game. Now I know what you're thinking: ""$59.99?! This isn't even considered a triple A title! That's like... that's like the price of CoD: Ghosts!"" Now, don't be intimidated by this price, for I can say that off the bat this game is worth a lot more than $59.99. From a value perspective, I found the price to be very reasonable based on the game's content nowadays.

Basically, ArmA is a series of hardcore military simulation; constantly reflecting real-world conditions into a video game. In ArmA 2, I feel that this was it's drawback, for there were certain scenarios where it was realistic to a point of frustration (breaking your leg on a 2 foot fall. It's a game guys, relax). ArmA 3 has found a good balance between an FPS/3rd Person shooter game and realism, making it extremely enjoyable as both a simulator [i] and [/i] a game. I also found that ArmA 3 has very good support for newbies to the series and is able to really engage players into the fun. I imagine it is much easier to get into ArmA 3 than I did ArmA 2 (I can't judge, I'm not new to it). 

The engine is decently optimized and is far less clunkier than the ArmA 2 engine, however rocks are still (and I guess forever will be) broken. Perhaps the game is having difficulty conforming such free player movement with an un-even surface. 

Pro tip: NEVER WALK ON ROCKS UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.

The game also has a variety of content; although players coming over from 2 will notice that there are A LOT less guns. This is partly due to the customization of guns. Instead of having a separate gun for each gun variation (M4A1 HOLO, M4A1 CCO, M4A1) you have a base gun and you are able to add sights, lasers, silencers, flashlights, what have you. However, this is not a full excuse- I feel that there are still a lesser amount of overall GUNS to shoot. Perhaps Bohemia Interactive is trying to fine-tune each gun into the patches as opposed to adding a ton of mediocre weapons simply for variety's sake. What's also very surprisingly good in this game is the Nvidia PhysX that was incorporated. Seeing my transport truck's wheels constantly bumping up and down according to the land under me while I drive troops through the night is oh-so-satisfying as well as, well... realistic! The physics engine has been extremely improved and I quite like it.

I'd like to finally talk about how the guns shoot and how they sound, for this is after all, a big part of the game. Once again I will compare it to ArmA 2, in saying clearly that ArmA 2 featured a more high-pitched ""tappy"" sound when you shot with vertical recoil, while 3 brings a much more deeper, louder shot as well as echo to accompany it as the gun travels backwards into your viewmodel as opposed to upwards. The guns definitely feel better for me, but in the end I'd like to classify this judgment as personal preference.

Lastly, the gamemodes of ArmA 3 are diverse and excellent, my favourite being Wasteland script. I won't go into detail here. There is also King of Hill, DayZ (OF COURSE, but it's MEH) and of course standard operations. Altis Life is also a really sweet one! Check those out if you end up buying.

So yeah, I really like this game and I think that there is so much potential for a growing community. Grab some buddies, hop into Stratis and keep overwatch with some snipers and riflers as you and your team move in through the bushes to grab an objective for more supplies for your squad! Really great game, I'd definitely recommend to any FPS/MILSIM fan! :D"
76561198257508149,107410,True,0.881924927234649658,"Arma 3 taught me that 25 fps is playable.
"
76561197963644421,107410,True,0.881744086742401123,"If you're coming to Arma 3 as an Arma series veteran, you already know what to expect. For the most part, the game hasn't changed since the last installment, but then it's always felt a little bit like Bohemia Interactive are still building on the groundwork laid back in 2001 by Operation Flashpoint, in the world's longest ever game of 'development Buckaroo'. Thankfully, the whole thing has yet to fall to pieces in any significant manner; it's quite happy to continue wobbling uneasily for now.

Arma has a reputation. It's known to be frighteningly obtuse, bewilderingly complex, and often hilariously broken. I can tell you right now that Arma 3 is no different, and absolutely still deserves that reputation. Thankfully, I don't think it's unfair to say that this is the closest an Arma game has come to being 'user friendly'. The controls have been tweaked, and the interface refined a little to accommodate more modern tastes. For these improvements alone, I do recommend it to newcomers to the series over any previous entry.
Coming from any other modern FPS game, it will still take a good few hours of what can feel an awful lot like hard work to get to grips with the controls, but I honestly think Arma 3 will see a far lower 'drop-out rate' of newbies who were frustrated to the point of giving up by the previous games.

At the time of writing, the elephant in the room is the lack of content available. When compared to Arma 2 (which is handsomely bolstered by an array of official expansion packs), the amount of hardware available to play with is frustratingly slim. In many cases, opposing armies are equipped with identical vehicles which get a slightly different paint job at best. For anyone used to the myriad of variants and oddments available in Arma 2, Arma 3 can feel awfully disappointing.
Fortunately, this is alleviated to some extent by the strong mod community. It has long been the case that the best parts of the Arma games are the parts not developed by Bohemia Interactive themselves, and Arma 3 is most definitely continuing this 'tradition'. Nevertheless, I can't help but feel that the game could've done with a few months more time in the oven before full public release.

Speaking of the mod community, I think it's criminal that almost none of the best, near-indispensible mods from Arma 2 have been officially integrated. For a self-professed 'war simulator', Arma 3 is hugely lacking in basic features like being able to rest your weapon on surfaces (even with a visible bipod), or tow damaged vehicles.

For all its flaws, though, Arma 3 is still a blast to play. If you can find a decent group of like-minded gamers with access to a voice-over-net server, you're in for some of the best gaming you'll ever experience. Sure, you'll probably have to load up on mods to satisfy your need for variety. And sure, sometimes the game will crash spectacularly, or the physics engine will flip out and kill you for standing too close to a wall. But when you're standing on a hilltop, looking out over an enemy outpost with your squadmates while a CAS helicopter strafes an enemy APC and spots targets for a distant sniper team; when everything clicks together in the way that only Arma can manage, you'll be glad to have been along for the ride."

76561198019977288,107410,True,0.875654399394989014,"I don't know where to start with this but let's just try:

My first experience with ArmA was with the Operation Flashpoint Series and later on with ArmA 1 (Cold war Assault) and then ArmA 2 (+ all possible Add-Ons).
And i just have to say, that i freakin fell in love with this game (ArmA3) from the very begining.

Sure there were heaves of problems, bugs and shit going wrong at the beginning but i still bought this game as soon as it was availabe (Which should've been like early Alpha or so).

But to explain why i sank over propably 2000 hours of my life into this game:

-Versatility: With the workshop added and all the mod support the game offers, it's just incredible for how long you are able to find new stuff. New Maps, weapons, uniforms, AI-Units, vehicles, helicopers, tanks, etc. etc.

-Versitility: With the ZEUS Modul and the Ed3n Editor you are able to creato soooooo much stuff. You can create YOUR OWN scenarios, and the overview them and change them while playing with zeus. if you play with a few people and you keep changing the missio maker you never ever ever run out of ideas/scenarios to play.

-Versitilititititiy: I think we've bee here before... With the huge mod support theres other beefits aswell. If you are playing onlie you will be able to find all sorts of server. wether you like playing as a lone wolf and kill other players, play in a huge team vs. AI encampments/bases, or just get flipping rich with selling apples. there's something for everyone out there.

But i don't want to hail everythig into the sky here, so here's a few negatives, which imo you should kow before you buy this:

-This game is in NO regards something for people lookig for a run & gun game. It's a Mil Sim after all.
-With the milsim aspect comes the complication of finding key bindings for everything you want to be able to do. so be preapared to learn buttloads of them (Especially with TFAR and ace in play).
-The graphics may look BRILLIANT on a good rig but if you are on minimum specs prepare for some frame problems,
 especially on bigger servers (although i have to say BI optimized a lot with the last few updates)

But other then that i can really just recommend this game if you are into military shooters that own you huge piles of different stuff.

And since my ""N"" key is fucked, here are some Ns for you guys that made it this far: n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n
That should've made up for the missed ones.

76561198030752353,107410,True,0.973724424839019775,"Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that it‚Äôs developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But it‚Äôs even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. 

At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the game‚Äôs complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your ass depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. 

Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3‚Äôs two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as I‚Äôm stuck on one mission that I simply can‚Äôt seem to complete.)

However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves.

Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). I‚Äôm sure there are so many others that I haven‚Äôt even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game.

In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless.

76561198031889408,107410,True,0.958130419254302979,"Been playing ARMA for almost 10 years now. It‚Äôs grown alongside me, and has created some of the most memorable moments I‚Äôve ever experienced in a videogame. It‚Äôs one of those games which, when it finally ‚Äòclicks‚Äô with you, never quite leaves you. You always find yourself going back to it. It‚Äôs not a game which necessarily empowers you like DOOM or Wolfenstein, but the pay-off from successfully pulling off that mission, that flank, that firing solution, that landing, even that single shot, is unparalleled. 

I‚Äôll always remember the moody fog of the APEX Protocol co-op missions as me and my friend crawled through the jungle, silently taking out patrols hunting for us with flashlights dancing in the dark. I‚Äôll always remember finally Escaping from Tanoa after six hours with my mates ‚Äî it felt like a hiking trip by the end. I‚Äôll always remember staying prone in a ghillie suit as a whole platoon of Russians patrolled past my squad, just like in All Ghillied Up. No other game can recreate the thrill or complexity of these memories in an emergent and inherently personal manner. 

My friends and I, after ten years, have talked for hours about that one mission which went so wrong or that incredible shot one of us made across a whole valley, or just how much we associate some terrains like Sahrani or Stratis with our first years as teenagers back at school. ARMA, for me, is an experience equal in its thrills and frustrations as it is in its nostalgia ‚Äî you come to learn these towns, these fields, these roads and valleys and recall them each as affectionately as the other. Sure, things go wrong: a miscommunication is made, a helicopter crashes, the physics engine freaks out, or the server messes up, but most of the time, you‚Äôll laugh through it. 

ARMA is unlike any other game ‚Äî any other experience. I think this ramble has been quite open in displaying just how much it means to me, and how much it will continue to mean to me. I can assure you, if you give it a chance, it will quickly mean as much to you too."

[h1]*I recommend this particularly for its multiplayer.[/h1]

+ Extremely mod friendly; enjoys full support from the Steam Workshop
+ Visuals & environmental design, save for a few issues here and there (i.e. empty buildings), has largely aged well & looks fantastic
+ Employs a deeply challenging level of realism
+ Multiplayer is still very active; boasts a wonderful variety of gameplay & modded servers to choose from
+ Long, content-packed single player campaign; player choices do affect potential endings, as there are several
+ Time control is back from Arma 2; player can speed up the passage of time, which helps SIGNIFICANTLY to combat the monotony of walking/running very long distances between objectives
+ Enormous map/playable area
+ User-created scenarios & a very easy-to-use scenario creator
+ Boasts incredibly varied gameplay mechanics; from piloting/driving myriad vehicles & gunships, to underwater missions, & everything in-between
+ Map & squad mechanics are back; while they may feel clunky to use in a combat scenario, a little practice goes a long way & serves to open up a slew of options on the battlefield

- Sound design is very hit & miss; some weapons sound identical to others, & vehicle sound effects tend to sound strangely muted
- Dialogue is also hit & miss; while I found the voice-acting to be done largely well, some of the dialogue is a bit awful
- Soundtrack often felt cheesy or inappropriate
- Mission pacing often feels very uneven; I felt that it often leaned too far into the realm of the tedious in the interest of realism (shouldn't be a bad thing in theory, but for the pruposes of a video game, it can put players to sleep in some missions)
- The initial learning curve is considerable, & the tutorial felt inadequate overall; mechanics are amazing on paper, but take an inordinate amount of time to master

76561197965925721,107410,True,0.955902099609375,"This is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming, this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things. Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality. There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release.

One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s.

As we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon. We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols. Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower.

There I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower. I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position. But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed.

As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive.

Falling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command. I had done it. I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive.

That is what this game is about."

Its the friends we made a long the way to commit those war crimes, every flipped convoy that ruins the operation 15 minutes from starting, its the AI shooting your though 30 layers of foliage, its the enemy artillery firing once but the shell exploding 6  times over a 3km radius, every new guy throwing a grenade under your feet while you play dress up in the arsenal, laughing your ass off as your Zeus tries to spice things up with roll playing, crying as Zeus retaliates for killing his roll play doll for ""lols"", every insane AT shot made by one of your guys, every terribly fired RPG you did, its every time the AI some how flanked you and every time you fight your way though it.

76561198007471493,107410,True,0.94609987735748291,"Where do I start with Arma 3...

 1st of all, have I played enough of this game? No, not in the slightest. My total playtime (see above) is pathetic in comparison to those around me. I see upwards of 2000, 3000, 4000 hours just looking at the reviews currently. At the time of writing this review, I sit on a measly 61 hours of gameplay, so I am in no way an expert of this game. 

 What I CAN  tell you is that there are moments in that 61 hours of gameplay that I will probably never forget. This game makes you feel things you won't feel in any other shooter. Call of Duty thrives on high adrenaline, rapid paced combat. Battlefield slows it down a bit, but maintains a good balance of action and spacing between engagements. 

 Arma 3 is a completely different ballpark. There is a LOT of spacing between engagements, which adds massive suspense and makes every firefight very, very meaningful. When combat initiates, there is definately adrenaline pumping action, but it's not fast. Combat is very slow, almost methodical (just like real life) but very, very... awesome. Some things that you'll see in an Arma firefight that you will not see anywhere else:
 - Engagements will be very long distance, often hundreds of meters away, especially if you're roaming the hills or open wilderness. Enemies may only be a fleck in your scope, on another hill entirely, several football fields away from you.
 - You often won't know where you're getting shot from if you're taken by surprise. You don't get any indicators that say ""Hey! someone to your left just shot you!"". Instead, you'll be forced to take cover and locate the enemy the old fashioned way: watching and listening.
 - If you get shot, you probably wont have time to react. One or two shots will kill you without much warning.
 - Teamplay is CRUCIAL. Medics, Anti-Tank, Heavy Gunners all have a part to play in their teams success. 
 - Communication on a whole other level. There is a radio/audio system in the game that is essential to a squad's success. Squad leaders will be vocal, squadees must be willing to take orders and communicate with their superioirs. Directions will not be called out like ""LEFT! RIGHT!"" but rather with compass bearings such as ""There's at least 3 of them at... 248""
 - Stand/Crouch/Prone is also at another level entirely. You can also hunch over, stand up super tall, sit down, lean on your side, bend your body left and right etc.. Manipulating these stances and using them to show as little of you as possible may be a key factor on whether you live or die
 - Every move you make has a pro and a con attached to it. Fire your weapon? Might kill someone, but you might also give your position away or get shot as you peak out of cover. Forget to look left? Arma teaches that wherever you don't look, there will be something that kills you.
 - NO HITMARKERS. You have to make your own call as to whether or not the guy you just shot is dead. If you make the wrong call, your squad may advance only for one of them to be shot by a (very much alive) enemy solider
 - Tanks and armored vehicles are terrifying. It's not like Battlefield where a tank shows up, everybody continues their daily routines and hopefully somebody with anti tank weaponry deals with the 15 ton chunk of metal. Armored vehicles are terrifyingly powerful with weapons foot soldiers can only dream of. A whole squad of 20 people will immediately hit the deck if one of them shpws up, hoping that their AT guys can do the job because...
  - You don't respawn back into the heat of battle. You reaspawn in a base in the middle of nowhere and you either have to take a helicopter to meet with your squad, or ""HALO jump"", which teleports you to an exaxct location but 6000 feet up in the sky, forcing you to have to use your parachute to land safely. HALO jumping back into combat is suicide. Big shiny glorified baloons make really, really good target practice. That also means...
  - If you lose that aforementioned anti-tank guy, you're hooped unless someone takes the risk and picks the launcher off his dead body. That is, unless the tank/armored car blows him up before he gets there. Then 20 people are stranded with very little to do, which means...
 - Every life counts.

 The combat is unreal. I remember we had to clear this city of enemies, entirely. It took us upwards of an hour, but  we checked every single building, room by room, until, In the center plaza, there he stood; the last man we had to kill. All the other building were checked, and I saw a head poking out behind this obstacle in the dead center of the city,

 ""I found him!"" I yell over the squad's radio, ""Central Garden, straight north"" I notice he pokes his head around the corner. My assault rifle was depleted.

 I knew I should have packed more flipping ammo.
 
 So I pull out my pistol. Fire, miss, fire, miss, rinse andrepeat. I empty my whole clip and the man is not dead. So I reload, and just start Terminator walking my way towards this guy. Firing every round I have. The guy doesn't poke his head out anymore. One clip exhausted, then another. And another. This guy will not die. I least I'm supressing him. 

 Then he pops around, shoots me once. Dead.

 My squad catches up ""What the hell was all that shooting?!"" the commander expresses.
 
 They grenade him. Dead.

 Wish I'd have thought of that sooner. 

 The medic gives me a nice repair. I borrow some mags off of him. We get on the chopper, talking about how wicked that mission was. We get a new one, something about planting a bomb somewhere.

 At this point the squad has bonded. We knew eachothers names, at least. We just kept talking, getting closer to the LZ, mocking the pilot for driving too low to the ground. We land and immediately, the chopper comes under fire.

 ""RUN! SPREAD OUT!""

 The heli blows up before it can leave. We all die in a blaze of glory.

 And I left the game after that.

 I cannot recommend this game enough."
76561198176296555,107410,True,0.944918155670166016,"I spent several years in the army and I gotta say this game is spot on with the training and atmosphere the military provides. I love how difficult this game is, and I love all of the different features the game provides. It is NOT easy to hit a target with an assault rifle from 300 yards in real life, and this game seems to match that same difficulty. Fatigue is a real thing and it seriously hinders your accuracy in real life...Arma 3 makes you stop and catch your breath if you run too far or carry too much gear, or you will have a hard time hitting your target. Enemies are not stupid and they have great vision. I was engaged by two enemies from about 200 yards away and they were using bushes for cover as well as 3-5 second rushes when moving. The AI is more advanced than the average taliban are in real life. haha :p Given my love for the military and for videogames, this one is definitely one of my favorites of all time :D"
76561198130981093,107410,True,0.943312287330627441,"I'm not into arma anymore, but as you can probably tell from the amount of hours I've spent paying this game; I've had an incredible time.

Most of the hours clocked into this game have been spent on roleplay servers. They were so fun back in the day..people weren't too serious, and neither too silly. It was very balanced, very fun. Very replayable.

But arma ain't all about roleplay, so let's talk about other things:

I'll start with combat mechanics, obviously - as the game is all about fighting lol. 
The combat is ABSOLUTELY FLIPPING GREAT! You got things like bullet drop which keeps you on your game, and other things such as weapons becoming less effective as the bullet travels mid-air..you also have very aweosme-looking postures which you can adopt; from laying prone, to sitting on your bum, to crouching, leaning side-to-side, and all dat weird jazz.

It's also very realistic in that, you can only take 1-5 shots before you die pending on which weapon is used against you and what kind of protective gear you have equipped. This means that you have to be VERY careful in-game, otherwise you might just get shot in the head and die. Personally, I enjoy such hardcore mechanics.
Another hardcore mechanic is how damage taken is based on where you are hit on your body. So if you've been shot in the head, you're likely to take a hell of a lot of damage, and this is where armour becomes a huge importance; without armour, you are as vulnerable as a mouse surrounded by a horde of cats. I shouldn't even need to stress how much you need armour! You can go light, or heavy - your choice. The amount you wear does affect movement speed though, so do be careful of that. It also affects how badass you look; I generally like to go light so I look like a badass mofo who is totally capable of destroying anyone who crosses my path lol. Not only that, but your appearance can also affect how easily an enemy can spot you. So if you have a huge bag on your back, and lightly coloured clothes- you can be sure people will spot you with ease.

So yeah. Useful information there, I know. But I am most certainly not done! We have to talk about the tanks, and the awesome vehicles that can totally blow ur balls off!

In arma, there are about 20 different ground vehicles, all unique in both appearance and purpose. You have a few anti-vehicle tanks, a few anti-people tanks, and a few artillery and anti-air tanks. Personally, I love the artillery....they're like mini nukes lol. 

You also have APPACHI ATTACK HELICTOPERS! I mean who doesn't like that!? And some awesome looking submarines and attack planes..and boats :):)
AND CARS WITH MOUNTED TURRETS ON!

Yeah, long-story-short -- arma has tons of vehicles, all awesome in both appearance and nature. Very useful for committing mass-genocide on dem pesky capitalist NATO forces....mmmm, satisfactory

Also sorry for not listing their names. I no good wit dat :(:(

Arma also has lots of game modes to choose from, so you're not restricted to just playing one gamemode and getting bored after an hour. I believe I've already listed one already; roleplay. Others include but are not limited to(due to custom game modes etc); TDM, KOH, KTF, PLAYER VS AI(forgot the official classification, sorry), 5v5 COMPETITIVE MATCHES (like that csgo competitive game mode), custom zombie modes, and survival modes. There are also singleplayer game modes which you can host, such as Zeus or custom Addons which allow for various different gameplay experiences; which brings me to my next topic...

There are loads of mods available on the steam workshop! From halo mods, to Star Wars, to enhanced combat system and mechanic mods, xcom mods, and various others which add more vehicles, factions, armour/clothing, more ai, etc...

The settings menus are also vast and fleshed out in arma, so you can rest assured that you'll be able to configure almost anything you want. 
The game also doesn't require a very high-tier computer to function nominaly, so lag shouldn't really be a problem; especially if you tune down the graphics via the settings menus a bit.

This'll be the last topic within this review; multiplayer.
Multiplayer is obviously a huge part of the game, as I've briefly mentioned previously(with the game modes). This game is almost solely multiplayer-based, but singleplayer is a thing and can be fun, so don't feel restricted. This game being focused mainly on multiplayer is obviously good for playing with friends. You can have much fun playing with friends online in this game, much fun indeed. Lag can be a problem though, so make sure you have a decent internet connection and don't be disappointed if you can't play with a friend based half way across the world from you :) but personally I feel the devs have really improved connectibility over the passed years in terms of multiplayer. Id say it's currently at its peak.

Check this game out. It's relatively cheap for its value, so I advise such.

Apologies if I've missed some flavourful features or mechanics. I'll definitely be sure to edit this review if anyone comes in screaming at me about how I didn't include ""this and that and this and that and this and that"" lol.

We're on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back. I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing.

I run, my Autorifleman runs, my Medic runs. But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across.

Anybody seen Full Metal Jacket all the way through? Remember the sniper scene?

The marksman takes a round in the leg as we're running and goes down. He then takes two more in the chest. The kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here.
He screams as he's being shot. Crawling, drenched in his own blood.
""SARGE? YOU AIN'T LEAVING ME OUT HERE LIKE THIS, RIGHT? I-I WANNA GO WITH YOU GUYS! C'MON SARGE, H-HELP ME! C'MON! PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!""

     Now that I am at almost 730 hours played at the time of this review's initial publication I thought it was time for me to review my favorite game. This is not going to be a typical review where they say something along the lines of ""swam in the air, 79 out of 10 would be break laws of physics again,"" although that has happened to me and it was hilarious. This is going to be an in depth and honest review of Arma 3.

First though, here is some context.

      When Arma 3 first came out in 2013 I was so excited because I had been watching Arma 2 for so long and I was really hyped on the Arma 3 trailers, not that I actually had a good enough computer to play either one of them of course, so I waited until I finally did. I waited for 3 1/2 years watching YouTube videos and wishing that I could have Arma 3, It was sheer torment. All the cool things that people did just made the situation worse: every valiant last stand against zombies that saved the city, every stealth mission that crippled the enemy, and every close air support gun run that saved a convoy that was under threat just made me want Arma 3 more. So, when I finally had a computer that was good enough to play games on it one of the first games that I got was Arma 3.

       Arma 3 was nothing like I had expected it to be, it was better. An entire virtual sandbox for me to do anything I wanted, go anywhere I wanted, and play any way I wanted. It was not like a ""sophisticated Battlefield"" or a ""Call of Duty on steroids"" like I was expecting it to be, or how I was told it was. Arma 3 is just better. Those descriptions don't even remotely do the game justice. The modding support is astounding to say the least, like I said earlier, zombies. The maps are gorgeous, the weapons are wonderfully modeled, and you have a fully customizable character from the face, to the clothes, to the voice. Arma 3 is more than meets the eye, sure it‚Äôs beautiful, but it also has a great deal of depth behind that gorgeous high polygon count tree, and highly reflective water, and I love it to death for it.

       Arma 3 is in some ways the next logical step for somebody who is into the first person shooter genre, you probably don't know what they say about the game but here it is anyway. ""Children play Call of Duty, boys play Battlefield, men play Arma."" I feel like this statement is true, at least on some levels. The Arma series just feels mature to me, and much more refined than Call of Duty or Battlefield as well. They are not games where you can easily be a""Super Duper MACV Recon SOG SEAL Delta Force Green Beret CIA Operator,"" go ""gunz blazin,"" and kill ""all dem dudes over dere."" Although that sometimes works much to my own surprise and amusement. Arma 3 requires at least some modicum of strategy, or my personal favorite, a great big helping of luck to win, or even be good at in some cases, and I think that is good thing, Arma demands that people invest time into.

       Arma 3 has a large amount of multiplayer content that somebody can enjoy, you can play on a life server and rise through the ranks to become whoever you want to be, whether you want to be are a brutal crime lord, or the mayor of the town. The king of the hill servers bring a nice challenge to Arma 3 where you can fight in and against, in a perfect world, a well organized group of players who are trying very diligently to accomplish their objectives in Arma 3's virtual world. I loved Arma so much that I decided to found a unit which can be found here: join.crabsunion.com

The choice really is up to you on what you want to do in the game, and the built in mission maker with the option to add a ""Zeus"" for mission changes on the fly is always a great option. It is fun to play God for a while, and terrorize your friends.

       The singleplayer content of Arma 3 is quite good, I am very much enjoying the new ""Stepping Stone"" campaign, where NATO forces are trying to seize the picturesque island of Malden in an attempt to attain and maintain aerial dominance over the critically important Strait of Gibraltar.The ""Apex Protocol Campaign"" is very well made in my opinion with several missions that make you feel like you really are a ""Super Duper MACV Recon SOG SEAL Delta Force Green Beret CIA Operator."" Another great thing about the Apex Protocol campaign is that it gives you the option of playing it with friends if you so choose, something I wish the other campaigns did as well.

       Many people say that Arma 3 has a steep learning curve and I disagree. You pick up new things very quickly in Arma 3, or at least I do. Arma 3 just has so much to learn that many people think that it is a very difficult game to play when it is not. Almost every time I play Arma 3 I learn something new about the game or how to play it more effectively. It does not matter whether this is some knowledge about how to use Zeus or make mission more effectively, if it is some new tactic for clearing houses, or even if it is a technique on how to get more stable frame rate. Even with my amount of play time, and the amount of videos I have watched on Arma 3, I am still learning new things constantly. I believe that fact alone sets Arma 3 apart from other games.

       Arma 3 is a somewhat underappreciated treasure in the gaming world with endless content and unlimited scenarios to explore and it deserves more publicity than it is getting. I hope that this review was helpful to you and informative as well. Furthermore I hope that it didn‚Äôt bore you to death too much. Anyways, you have a great day now."

76561198057309553,107410,True,0.932174444198608398,"I have owned this game for a number of weeks now and I have been completely hooked. Great game for the more serious war gamer, not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from Call of Duty series which I consider more for the younger gamers anyway.

Arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games, similar to Battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using. You will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10-20 minutes in a single location (sometimes longer, I personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward.

You will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance.

You can not respawn as quickly as you can in CoD if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic.

The graphics are great, the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to.

I recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible (unless doing paintballing or airgunning), and if you do buy the game - I recommend completing the whole VR Tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the Campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game."

August 20th 2019. I was in a Squad of 7 men. I had the duty of a combat life saver. We had to fly oversea's on a Helicopter. I couldn't tell if my pilot was drunk or my dial up internet was making the helicopter do acrobatics but it was intense. About 5 minutes of flying we touch down safely, getting out as my ears immediately explode from my sound mod making the helicopter 5000x louder. It was awesome. We continue down the road for another 200m when a sniper from the treeline blows off one of my boys heads. We all scramble for cover behind the hill. My boy and I had to kill the MMG who were suppressing our men. We take a flank to the left in hopes of gunning this asshole down. Because the AI are fucking superman, me and my boy were immediately spotted and suppressed by sniper fire behind a rock. He gets hit in the chest which caused a velocity wound and other medical wounds. I sew him up like the god I am and we continue down the hill under all sorts of fire. I take a bullet to my arm and leg, making me as slow as a 60 year old asthmatic hippo with 3 legs. I stitch up my wounds and began limping to some more cover. I fix my leg somehow and im mobile again, pushing into the objective we were supposed to take an hour ago. Our NATO squad successfully raided the base. Only 2 men were killed and all CSAT have been eliminated.

Or so we thought.

The man on the radio sounds like his balls dropped off Mount Everest. He tells us CSAT reinforcements will be arriving shortly. I was unprepared with only 3 mags of ammunition and only a few medical bandages and morphine left. After a few minutes of respite, a shot is echoed from the hills and another firefight takes place again. These assholes now have armored cars with .50 guns on them. 4 of our men are killed within seconds. Thankfully i brought AT rockets with me and I take out the armored car. It explodes in a fiery mess, leaving that area scorched. My boy and I take cover behind a shitty jeep as more and more bullets fly over our heads. He gets hit in the chest 2 times and in the leg 3. I'm out of ammunition in both weapons and I am forced to drag him behind a tree. I take a hit to my chest and start to bleed out. Medical supplies are running thin. 

A few minutes passed and the CSAT have stopped firing. They probably thought we all died. I failed to medic my friend as his cold, dead body lay in the grass. I scavenge off my dead teammates for ammo, leaving my aim in the garbage due to the multiple wounds to the arms. Just when I thought all was over, a NATO chopper has came to evacuate me. I have a blood pressure of the exact definition of trash, my heart rate is 50 and my screen is black and white. I'm limping up a hill while taking multiple shots from the CSAT hiding in the thick brush. I am able to get into the chopper and escape as the last man in my squad to live. 

From that day on, I have diagnosed myself with PTSD. Only play if your balls are made of titanium."

76561198123083438,107410,True,0.926028549671173096,"For this review I'm going to open with a price breakdown, because at the end of the day when you're looking at getting a game you're trying to figure out whether or not it's worth it.

[h1]Price Breakdown[/h1]
Full price of the game and all DLC without deals or bundles $200.25

With my 4,000 hours of gameplay that equates to
 $0.0502375 an hour of playtime (Or about 5 cents)
 $1.2057 a day of playtime

Days between 1 August 2016 (When I bought it) and 12 March 2020 (date of this review)
That's 1,319 days or 31,656 hours
 $0.00632581501137225170583775587566‚Ä¨ an hour (or about half a cent)
 $0.15181956027293404094010614101592 a day (Or about 15 cents)


Arma is a near future military sandbox experience that gives players access to play how they want, whether they want to be infantry, tank operators, war journalists, helicopter pilots, jet pilots, boat captains, divers. Arma has something to suit any players wants.

[h1]Are the DLCs worth it?[/h1]
So when we're looking at value it is well worth it. I often run into people going on in lobbies about how Arma is always bringing out DLCs that cost way too much for what they are and that Bohemia is just a moneyhungering company, but when you break it down the level of detail they bring to the table and the time you spend on the content is unparalleled in terms of replayability. Aside from the singleplayer campaigns and the maps introduced in DLCs all of the content is actually free to use whether you own the DLC or not, the only downside is that if you do use something that you don't own the DLC for then a watermark will show up on the side of your screen for a few seconds every five to ten minutes or so.

It seems that in many peoples eyes the most cardinal sins are the Contact DLC and Laws of War DLC. But I only ever hear complaints about them from people that when I get into debates with them they say 'Oh, I forgot Arma had a singleplayer."" or ""Pfffft, no one plays the singleplayer."" But this last statement couldn't be more wrong. In fact in terms of parts of this game that shine, the singleplayer campaigns and missions are a big part of that.

[h1]Singleplayer[/h1]
The way the tutorial seemlessly blends into the story of the larger campaign, to the political turmoil you find yourself being embroiled in, to the intrigue of the moral dilemmas you find yourself asking at the end of the Laws of War campaign. These stories are memorable! If you ever dip your hands in the Zeus gamemode (the veritable Dungeons and Dragons of the Armaverse) you'll often find yourself recreating some of those memorable experiences for other players, such as the uneasy downtime and that suspenseful few moments before a major gunfight.

[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]
If singleplayer isn't your thing then the multiplayer will keep you coming back again and again, whether you want to have a PVP killfest in King of the Hill, a PVE mission based gamemode in Invade and Annex or Antistasi, the aforementioned Zeus gamemode, a roleplay experience in ArmaLife servers, or a hardcore military simulation. Arma has it all. When it comes to the multiplayer, most of my most enjoyable moments have been the downtime in between missions, whether chilling at the base or traveling to the area of operations. Arma multiplayer is a social experience at heart and that's where the multiplayer experience really shines in my eyes. I have met many people over the years that I am still good friends with to this day, and I have Arma to thank for that. We have had good times together and even better stories to tell. When I was first playing this game I didn't have a microphone so I had to type everything I wanted to get across, because of that I inadvertently learnt touch typing, which is pretty strange to say when someone asks you how you learnt to touch type. The official servers can become quite chaotic, but if you find a nice server a community is hosting then that can be like a second home, even with some of the chaotic people in the official servers the community as a whole is the most welcoming community I've come across in a game.

[h1]Community[/h1]
Touching on the community, Arma has a strong and committed modding and content creation community, mainly due to the passion of the users and the easy to use modding and mission creation tools, such as the 3DEN editor, a 3d mission maker contained within the game itself which harkens back to the golden age of Real Time Strategy games, such as Age of Empires. So if what you want to do isn't quite in the game, you're sure to find a mod or a mission that allows you to do that and if you can't there is an abundance of information on how to make it yourself. And with the easeability of sharing modlists, it's easy to bundle all of the mods you need to make the experience you want to play and then share the list with your mates so that you can all play together.

[h1]Is Arma The Game For You?[/h1]
All in all there is a lot of downtime in this game, so if you're all about instant gratification, killstreaks and being the best of the best then this game probably isn't for you. Arma is a team game and a lot of the game is spent walking, travelling or planning which gives you a lot of time to get to know your team. So if you're not into that then this might not be the game for you when it comes to the multiplayer. If you're looking for a game that is a million different games however, Arma is for you. Because every experience is different and with mods it can even be an entirely different game, for an example just look at DayZ or PlayersUnknownBattlegrounds which both started their lives as mods on Arma.

Arma 3, best 4,000 I've spent in a game ever."
76561198097852352,107410,True,0.925913095474243164,"After putting in over 3500 hours, I have seen the good, the bad, and the downright ugly that ARMA III has to offer. With that being said, I offer my review. It will be a bit long, but after this much time in game, there is a lot to discuss. 

First off, the campaign for single player is ok, but not great. You will be able to find other games with better campaign story modes than ARMA III as the main focus is put on the Multiplayer aspect. However, the campaign and story does prove challenging and the story is solid enough to keep you entertained and engaged. 

Secondly, The DLC content is hit or miss. 

GOOD DLC!
-Tanks add several new tanks into the game and make putting a AP round through your enemy a joy!
-Jets add several new jets to wreak havoc with! It also adds a aircraft carrier!
-Marksman adds some of the best sniper rifles in the game period! Also adds several ghillie suits and scopes. 

Decent DLC.
-Helicopters adds two helis to the game. Mostly for heavy lifting. 
-APEX adds an Island called Tanoa. A dozen weapons and gear. A few vehicles and a few VTOL aircraft. 

Bad DLC!
-Karts. Go-karts on a battlefield. Is this a joke?
-Laws of War. A single player mini campaign for a multiplayer focused game.  Not worth your money.
- Tac-Ops. Again, another single player mini campaign in a multiplayer focused game. Not worth your money.

Third on the list in multiplayer. The true fun to be had with ARMA III is through the multiplayer. There are 1000's of servers all with different options to chose from fitting nearly every type and style of game play. Zombies, they got it. Not into Zombies? No problem. Co-op, yep! Role play, check! Survival, you bet! PvP for those that like to kill others and PvE for the more casual crowd can be found.

Fourth. The community of players found in ARMA III are some of the best I have seen. They are often found to be helpful and willing to lend a hand to newer players and also to veterans in need of assistance. With that being said, you will however run into the occasional troublemaker, rule breaker, or very rarely a hacker. Most of them are dealt with swiftly by the server admins. Then, also,  there is those few players who have little time to read the server rules and blindly run off into the battlefield annoying players by doing things they shouldn't. When corrected by others, they will usually reply "" I didn't know the rules. "" A word of advice. When entering a server, read the rules or simply ask in chat and other players will usually be happy to explain them. 

Fifth, the graphics. For a game that is over 5 years old, the graphics are good. Not great mind you, but good to say the least. 

Sixth, the game play. ARMA III focuses on two things. Realistic militarised game play and multiplayer action via servers. Most of the servers run mods created by people like you and me. Some are about survival and will have you scrounging the map for supplies and gear. Some are about playing team death-match. Some are co-op missions. They can be very fun and can add a lot of vehicles, maps, gear, aircraft, weapons, scenarios, and more to the game. However, no one is prefect and you will find yourself dead periodically after simply opening a door, walking down stairs, entering a vehicle, exiting a vehicle, etc. The point is, expect the unexpected. While this does not happen all the time, you most definitely will encounter a few bugs and glitches from time to time. The most common and frustrating is the sudden vanishing of vehicles left at your base. ARMA loves to eat vehicles for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Also, it will eat your gear, weapons, base, and well....pretty much anything.  So don't get too attached to your stuff. As a server admin for several different servers, I have spent entire days replacing lost items. However, do not expect all admins to be as accommodating as losing items in ARMA is all part of the game.

In all, ARMA III can be a very fun game to play. It's strength comes from the almost limitless ways the game can be played on the 1000's of available servers. After all this time, I still find myself spending the weekends running missions on several servers. In the end, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes realistic military style games."

311 days ago i was Developer banned from Arma 3. The day before i received this ban i had decided to download arma after months away from it. I downloaded the game, it remembered all my mods, downloaded them then i fired the game up.

Do you lads feel out of sorts some times and you sit looking at you vast steam library wondering what to play. Its kinda like choosing a film on Netflix, before you know it times up and you cant be bothered. It was like that. I sat in the in game menu for one minute (screen shot to prove it) before deciding not to play. I exited the game, steam and shut down my PC. 

The following day i decided i was going to fully get back into it. I loaded up my computer. Steam automatically opened but this time with a message. You have been banned from the following games (ARMA 3).

It stated i was banned by the developer. I immediately thought why the hell was i banned. I contacted BI within ten minutes. The response was the same as it remains today. 'we do not deal with bans, battleye do. Please contact battleye if you need support with a ban.' 

BUT YOU DO DEAL WITH BANS - THIS IS A DEV BAN NOT A BE BAN????

I spent the last 10 months contacting BE who eventually responded to tell me that they did not ban me nor did they find anything on my PC that was suspicious to them at the time of my ban. They informed my my logs were 'spotless'

I swung my attention back around to BI. I contacted them the other day. A chap called Dominik responded saying the ban was a battleye ban not a DEV ban.  I have since sent him images of my ban stating it was a DEV ban, steams explanation of a DEV BAN which states a developer informs valve of an account that is suspicious and valve ban them. I have sent images of my conversation with BE and proof that in the two weeks before my ban i had one minute of game time which was spent in the menu. 

The emails have fallen of deaf ears.....No response from Dominik. 

I am absolutely heart broken that from the past 10 months i have been unable to play with my friends and it looks like this situation is not going to change. I am disgusted as the lack of acknowledgement and willingness to support and resolve this from BI. 

I have so many fond memories in Arma 2, OH & 3 but it looks like this is the end of the road for me. I will miss the random chats in game, the communities i was part of and the battles of the field. 

You never know, if you guys blow this up they might just let me back :)"

76561198061912275,107410,True,0.910561800003051758,"Arma 3 is like that long-term girlfriend/boyfriend you date where, at the honeymoon phase, you are smitten and are like ""wow, this is a 10/10 unique experience."" However, as the months turn to years and time rolls on, you start to realize there are shinier, prettier experiences out there- better looks, sexier moves, more stable, but you stick with it. You realize you're really with a solid 7/10, but **** is it fun. There are things he/she can do that no one else can, and well, despite deviations time to time to fantasize about other experiences, and several on-again/off-again times spent dabbling in those fantasies, you find yourself coming back to him/her. You find yourself truly happy...even after the worst (and unstable) times. Come to think of it, maybe this isn't a healthy relationship, but at the end of the day, it's a **** fun one.

Arma is an unstable, buggy ride and a bit overwhelming on first impressions, but it's an experience that you don't get in any other sandbox game or military shooter. The community is really what drives this game. It's a quasi-sim/quasi-arcade experience that can be tailored to the community/user's need given a little time spent learning how it all works. The developers do a decent job of providing documentation to understand how content creation and mission editing functions, and the community fills (and exceeds) the areas unfulfilled and self-imagined. There are few communities as diverse and robust as Arma's. In one night's events, you can go from playing a modern-day military sim night with your homies, to WWII, Vietnam, then Star Wars, Halo, Starship Troopers, Aliens, to the bloody revolutionary war and more. In short, Arma should be judged more as a sandbox & framework for community addons than a game on its own, and one that over the last 6 years developed into being highly accessible to the average user without even needing to touch a text editor or understand how it works to get custom games going through its implementation of a ""Dungeon Master"" style mission builder called ""Zeus."" Arma's experience varies greatly depending on your level of tolerance for troubleshooting and patience with searching/installing addons. 

This is best experienced by being dragged in by a community of friends... really it's kind of Stockholm Syndrome that kept me in it to start, and the incredible, fun, sometimes frustrating, and hilarious experiences made along the way is something no other game has offered and keeps me coming back. Give it a go, or watch some communities stream their experiences and see for yourself."

76561197979139992,107410,True,0.908434510231018066,"Well after playing this game for a few hours I thought it was about time to write a review.

I struggle to think of many games past or present that manage to do what Arma 3 does. Before the impending praise I'm about to give this game I will say 2 things. 

First, there will be bugs. Not the Starship Troopers kind... Well actually you can kill bugs as a Starship Trooper but I'm talking glitches, rubber banding, inventory issues, layer upon layer of mods causing compatibility issues and the list goes on. You simply have to embrace these problems and make them part of the enemy which you have to overcome! If you are easily put off by the above, Arma isnt for you, in fact the way games are pushed out these days a don't think many games would be for you.

Second, so far I have spent ¬£150 on this game (not including money spent on my own private server endeavours and donations to other public server communities) which sounds and is slightly ridiculous HOWEVER I have spent over 6000 hours on this game which is more than the rest of my steam library combined so as a time spent versus money paid its the cheapest game I've ever bought. All I say to anyone who somehow doesn't own it yet is wait for a Steam super sale and buy everything in one nice discount and your laughing!

The above remain the only 2 reasons I would not recommend this game, price Inc all dlc and the constant battle with bugs etc. All that aside Arma 3 is simply one of the best things you can buy for your PC. From the seemingly infinite Steam Workshop content to the fact that you can do anything from Milsim team based combat to simple PvP to cooperative missions to RPG style game modes to racing mods and a small off shoot you may have heard of called DayZ (Arma 2 mod but ya know what I'm getting at) it really does tick every box. There is a huge learning curve in the form of keybindings. It takes time just finding the right section to rebind keys but once you are comfortable I find the control of your character, chopper, jet, quad bike, humvee, tank, golf caddy etc quite intuitive. No other game gives you as many stances to be in. You can literally find a stance which gives you line of sight through a small hole in a wall at any angle. There are basic and advanced settings for flying so you can feel like a pro or take it easy with simplified physics and controls.

One final word... Community! As with all games you are bound to find trolls and people too competitive to remember what manners are, however on the whole Arma has a great community of players. I play 90% coop missions these days and it is just a breath of fresh air to be playing multiplayer on such a grand scale without this furious and frantic atmosphere which is so prominent in most multilayer games these days. After the demise of the Battlefield franchise after BC2 and BF3 I really needed a game to fill my need for military shooters and Arma 3 came to my rescue.

Rather than go on and on, all I will end on saying is that this game is more like a template for you to then decide what you actually want to spend your time doing. If you are on the fence, browse the workshop and see the sheer amount of 5 star community made content from overhaul mods to subtle quality of life mods. You could spend 6000 hours just playing all the single player campaigns made by other users."

Crowd around, children, it's story time.

One day, not so long ago, my squad had just destroyed an anti-air battery. Our pilot landed, and the rest of the squad boarded one by one. I was about to get in when the rockets started flying.

The chopper lifted off, with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes. Unwilling to die before then, I rushed to the nearest cover, a small house by a narrow road. I entered to find a ten year-old player who had also been left behind. He explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his ""clan"".

I politely declined, explaining that my own squad was inbound. As I finished, a Ghost Hawk flew over the horizon. My squad had arrived.

This noble child soldier and I were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting. The sniper screamed as a 6.5 mm cartridge entered his leg. His shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as I climbed in the transport.

My new friend was dead.

Grossly outdated graphics engine, poorly optimised, it remains the closest game you can ever play to the real thing. During its heyday, milsim communities and modders made this more of an experience than some simple combat simulator - I was able to don exactly the same equipment, uniform and loadouts that I served with while in the army.
NOT worth it if you're playing vanilla arma - terrifying and immersive if you use mods.
You can eat, climb walls, abseil, drink, splint fractures, dress burns, dig foxholes, engage in melee, interrogate, be suppressed and find yourself in a house being breached and cleared by the enemy.
Unless it's vanilla...

76561197971414496,107410,True,0.896043360233306885,"Arma 3 is a tricky game to review, but here‚Äôs me trying it anyway.

The reason why this game is so hard to review lies in the sheer size of the game and the variety of things it may or may not offer for the player.

I take Arma 3 for what it is first and foremost: a platform. What you get is a good looking game with a solid (would be great, but you have to do some optimization to boost your performance) engine, two amazing maps (Stratis and Altis, which is probably the most impressive map I‚Äôve seen in any open world-ish game) and the prospect of near endless new content from the community.

What you don‚Äôt get is an easy to get into mil-shooter with CoD sized maps and a quick pace. If you‚Äôre in for uncomplicated, fast paced PvP gameplay, you should probably look elsewhere. If you‚Äôre sick of that, however, Arma 3 might be just your thing. 

The strength of the Arma series is freedom (**** yeah). You are free to mod the game into almost anything you want, create any type of mission and make your very own gameplay experience. You have to invest some time into the game, but once you got into it, the opportunities are endless.

Want to play huge adversial or coop maps with a hundred players or more?  Arma is just your thing and there are big communities (in many different languages) that will help you find that epic experience.

Want to play singe player? Well, if you expect strong single player content with interesting characters and storyline and so on, then Arma 3 isn‚Äôt the game you‚Äôre looking for.  Or is it? Right now Bohemia delivered one part of a three part campaign ‚Äì those missions are challenging, offer a solid variety of infantry gameplay but don‚Äôt expect a good story or interesting characters. But as mentioned before ‚Äì the huge amount of community made missions and mods offer hours and hours of playtime.

Personally I prefer small cooperative missions to play with friends. Already the steam workshop has countless missions for 2-5 players. 

So, should you buy Arma 3? Well, I‚Äôd certainly recommend it, if any of the things I mentioned above sounds fun to you. It is to say though, that this game is not something that everyone might like, so stay away from it if you are not willing to invest some time into it.

I hope that this review helped some people to decide whether or not they should by Arma 3. Please note that I‚Äôm not a native English speaker, so the language used in this review might seem a little odd for some."

Briefly, I remember that every single second I've played this game is my favorite memory. As I do so, the developer's splash screen flashes on the screen, followed by the warm  welcome of the ARMA III logo and subsequent main menu screen. In this moment, I feel happy and fulfilled. The events of the real world bear no importance to me as I undertake the task of deciding what I'm going to get myself into today. Shall it be Altis life antics? Do I recreate the Osama Bin Laden raid with my friends? Should I attempt to put myself into the shoes of a Marine in the middle of the Tet Offensive of late 1968? My mind wanders into the child-like curiosity and the uncertainty of the events that will take place tonight, and therefore I am excited. This is my conscious mind. My subconscious, however, is aware of one simple, true fact. I am free."

[b] Welcome to Arma 3: The Big One [/b]

If you didn't just start PC gaming an hour ago, you've probably heard of Arma 3. Every time someone says the names Call of Duty, Battlefield, Squad, Red Orchestra, Verdun, or any other shooter title out there, they do so in hushed tones and with their hands over their mouths for fear of the inevitable tongue-lashing they're about to receive from an Arma fan.
Fans of the Arma series are fiercly loyal and totally uncompromising. I have little doubt you've heard the following phrases:

[list]
[*]""If you want [i] realism, [/i] you should play Arma.""
[*]""Only casuals play. . . .""
[*]""Arma 3 is way better because . . . .  and  . . . . ""
[/list]

It's annoying and inarguably elitist but, in their defense, also mostly true. Arma 3 is not for someone who is looking for a casual shooter experience. Arma 3 is for those of us that want to camp out in the trees, waiting for the three guys you saw 30 minutes before, and hoping you can pull of a successful ambush quickly, quietly, and without getting hit. Then, walking for another 30 minutes to link up with another squad, grab some vehicles, and truck a few kilometers out to set up a new FOB. You can expect to go upwards of 3 hours without firing a shot on certain servers.

Which brings me to my next point. . . 

[b] The Game Within a Game Within a Game Within a Game. . . . [/b]

One of A3's major selling points is it's massive, active, dedicated, and diverse community of modders. Arma 3 has a great single player campaign and a few nice King of the Hill and Wasteland servers that you will want to visit occasionally, but Arma gets particularly interesting when you go mod shopping. 

in the mood to lose track of 30 hours while you're dodging police officers and rival gangs as you fight to expand your criminal empire across Altis and/or Tanoa?
Asylum 'Life' servers are a personal favorite of mine. Complete with a living, player-driven economy, impactful politics between gangs and a police force trying to keep control of the island as these gangs throw lead and shade at one another in a constant struggle for turf. If that sounds familiar to you, make no mistake, GTA V doesn't come close to touching the complexity of Life servers.

There are mods for different eras of warfare, gamemodes for about anything you can imagine, and you can find most of them on Steam Workshop, making it easy to access and giving you infinite playtime. You literally cannot run out of things to do because there is [i] always [/i] more content.

I could honestly write about Arma all evening but I'll leave you with a few pros and cons and then I'll wrap things up for you.

[b] PROS: [/b]
[list]
[*]Infinite play value, you can never run out of content
[*]satisfying and memorable moments come to those with patience
[*]game modes for almost everything thanks to the modding community
[*]great graphics for excellent immersion
[*]Endless selection of weapons, vehicles, gear, etc.
[*]Shed your 'casual' title and pick up the mark of 'master' gamer
[/list]

[b] CONS: [/b]
[list]
[*]Arma 3 is not well optimized and is very CPU intensive. Still perfectly playable at 30fps though you will need a high end i7 if you expect to get anywhere near 60fps on most multiplayer servers. AMD users be warned.
[*]Seriously not for casual gamers. I cannot stress this enough. It can take hours to accomplish simple goals depending on your game mode. Highly satisfying when things come together, though.
[*]Expect to move slowly while learning controls. Arma 3 is a game that uses just about [i] all [/i] of your keyboard and it will take you a while to master.

[b] But Should I Buy It? [/b]

I can't recommend this game enough. But if you're a die-hard Call of Duty fan but you still pick up this title, you're in for a rude awakening. Casual gamers be warned."
76561198072447858,107410,True,0.889115750789642334,"What did you do today? I did walk into a stopsign and died in Arma 3.
Meh.. After 3099 hours and 15000 deaths later it's still a game you will return back to.
Thumbsup all the way."
76561198026803446,107410,True,0.888425886631011963,Just buy it. Look at how many hours I have in this game. It's the best money you'll ever spend. It is all things to all gamers.
76561197995591955,107410,True,0.88792949914932251,"Can't tell you if you should buy it or not, but I can tell you this.
You will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isn't there and lack of content if you're not satisfied with what you have. 
But when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, it's something magical you just can't find in any other game.

Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly.
Arma is a game which you can never called finished. There will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations. 

Hope I expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :)

If you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem!

I'll give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, I've used hundreds of hours on Arma 3 that I would never take back.

Now, some people don't care much for the realism, and prefer action-movie esque shooters. That's fine. However, this game shines at gritty realistic firefights. There's nothing glorious about shouting contact reports into the radio, bounding cover to cover, and hoping the next round doesn't have your name on it, but when you're finally back on the bird with your buddies headed home, and you finally feel the sense of relief wash over you.

I have to admit, if you decide to start getting in depth with this game, it will be hard to stop depenending in which gamemode you play on. Life servers =Your done. Once you start progressing from rank to rank you'd never want to stop. This game is amazing, but very addictive to the point where someone like me has 4k hours on it."
76561198049422365,107410,True,0.882125139236450195,"Being an avid ArmA 2 Wasteland/DayZ player back in the day (about 1.5 years ago), I relished the thought of a new ArmA coming out. ArmA 2 was practically uknown until it's popularity was increased by DayZ. I found it interesting to jump into a BI (Bohemia Interactive) title that already had a steady fan-base behind it. Having been about a year since I purchased this game (launch) and over 100 hours of solid gameplay I feel that I can finally write a review that encompasses many of the aspects I have experienced within this game. Now I know what you're thinking: ""$59.99?! This isn't even considered a triple A title! That's like... that's like the price of CoD: Ghosts!"" Now, don't be intimidated by this price, for I can say that off the bat this game is worth a lot more than $59.99. From a value perspective, I found the price to be very reasonable based on the game's content nowadays.

Basically, ArmA is a series of hardcore military simulation; constantly reflecting real-world conditions into a video game. In ArmA 2, I feel that this was it's drawback, for there were certain scenarios where it was realistic to a point of frustration (breaking your leg on a 2 foot fall. It's a game guys, relax). ArmA 3 has found a good balance between an FPS/3rd Person shooter game and realism, making it extremely enjoyable as both a simulator [i] and [/i] a game. I also found that ArmA 3 has very good support for newbies to the series and is able to really engage players into the fun. I imagine it is much easier to get into ArmA 3 than I did ArmA 2 (I can't judge, I'm not new to it). 

The engine is decently optimized and is far less clunkier than the ArmA 2 engine, however rocks are still (and I guess forever will be) broken. Perhaps the game is having difficulty conforming such free player movement with an un-even surface. 

Pro tip: NEVER WALK ON ROCKS UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.

The game also has a variety of content; although players coming over from 2 will notice that there are A LOT less guns. This is partly due to the customization of guns. Instead of having a separate gun for each gun variation (M4A1 HOLO, M4A1 CCO, M4A1) you have a base gun and you are able to add sights, lasers, silencers, flashlights, what have you. However, this is not a full excuse- I feel that there are still a lesser amount of overall GUNS to shoot. Perhaps Bohemia Interactive is trying to fine-tune each gun into the patches as opposed to adding a ton of mediocre weapons simply for variety's sake. What's also very surprisingly good in this game is the Nvidia PhysX that was incorporated. Seeing my transport truck's wheels constantly bumping up and down according to the land under me while I drive troops through the night is oh-so-satisfying as well as, well... realistic! The physics engine has been extremely improved and I quite like it.

I'd like to finally talk about how the guns shoot and how they sound, for this is after all, a big part of the game. Once again I will compare it to ArmA 2, in saying clearly that ArmA 2 featured a more high-pitched ""tappy"" sound when you shot with vertical recoil, while 3 brings a much more deeper, louder shot as well as echo to accompany it as the gun travels backwards into your viewmodel as opposed to upwards. The guns definitely feel better for me, but in the end I'd like to classify this judgment as personal preference.

Lastly, the gamemodes of ArmA 3 are diverse and excellent, my favourite being Wasteland script. I won't go into detail here. There is also King of Hill, DayZ (OF COURSE, but it's MEH) and of course standard operations. Altis Life is also a really sweet one! Check those out if you end up buying.

So yeah, I really like this game and I think that there is so much potential for a growing community. Grab some buddies, hop into Stratis and keep overwatch with some snipers and riflers as you and your team move in through the bushes to grab an objective for more supplies for your squad! Really great game, I'd definitely recommend to any FPS/MILSIM fan! :D"
76561198257508149,107410,True,0.881924927234649658,"Arma 3 taught me that 25 fps is playable.
"
76561197963644421,107410,True,0.881744086742401123,"If you're coming to Arma 3 as an Arma series veteran, you already know what to expect. For the most part, the game hasn't changed since the last installment, but then it's always felt a little bit like Bohemia Interactive are still building on the groundwork laid back in 2001 by Operation Flashpoint, in the world's longest ever game of 'development Buckaroo'. Thankfully, the whole thing has yet to fall to pieces in any significant manner; it's quite happy to continue wobbling uneasily for now.

Arma has a reputation. It's known to be frighteningly obtuse, bewilderingly complex, and often hilariously broken. I can tell you right now that Arma 3 is no different, and absolutely still deserves that reputation. Thankfully, I don't think it's unfair to say that this is the closest an Arma game has come to being 'user friendly'. The controls have been tweaked, and the interface refined a little to accommodate more modern tastes. For these improvements alone, I do recommend it to newcomers to the series over any previous entry.
Coming from any other modern FPS game, it will still take a good few hours of what can feel an awful lot like hard work to get to grips with the controls, but I honestly think Arma 3 will see a far lower 'drop-out rate' of newbies who were frustrated to the point of giving up by the previous games.

At the time of writing, the elephant in the room is the lack of content available. When compared to Arma 2 (which is handsomely bolstered by an array of official expansion packs), the amount of hardware available to play with is frustratingly slim. In many cases, opposing armies are equipped with identical vehicles which get a slightly different paint job at best. For anyone used to the myriad of variants and oddments available in Arma 2, Arma 3 can feel awfully disappointing.
Fortunately, this is alleviated to some extent by the strong mod community. It has long been the case that the best parts of the Arma games are the parts not developed by Bohemia Interactive themselves, and Arma 3 is most definitely continuing this 'tradition'. Nevertheless, I can't help but feel that the game could've done with a few months more time in the oven before full public release.

Speaking of the mod community, I think it's criminal that almost none of the best, near-indispensible mods from Arma 2 have been officially integrated. For a self-professed 'war simulator', Arma 3 is hugely lacking in basic features like being able to rest your weapon on surfaces (even with a visible bipod), or tow damaged vehicles.

For all its flaws, though, Arma 3 is still a blast to play. If you can find a decent group of like-minded gamers with access to a voice-over-net server, you're in for some of the best gaming you'll ever experience. Sure, you'll probably have to load up on mods to satisfy your need for variety. And sure, sometimes the game will crash spectacularly, or the physics engine will flip out and kill you for standing too close to a wall. But when you're standing on a hilltop, looking out over an enemy outpost with your squadmates while a CAS helicopter strafes an enemy APC and spots targets for a distant sniper team; when everything clicks together in the way that only Arma can manage, you'll be glad to have been along for the ride."

76561198019977288,107410,True,0.875654399394989014,"I don't know where to start with this but let's just try:

My first experience with ArmA was with the Operation Flashpoint Series and later on with ArmA 1 (Cold war Assault) and then ArmA 2 (+ all possible Add-Ons).
And i just have to say, that i freakin fell in love with this game (ArmA3) from the very begining.

Sure there were heaves of problems, bugs and shit going wrong at the beginning but i still bought this game as soon as it was availabe (Which should've been like early Alpha or so).

But to explain why i sank over propably 2000 hours of my life into this game:

-Versatility: With the workshop added and all the mod support the game offers, it's just incredible for how long you are able to find new stuff. New Maps, weapons, uniforms, AI-Units, vehicles, helicopers, tanks, etc. etc.

-Versitility: With the ZEUS Modul and the Ed3n Editor you are able to creato soooooo much stuff. You can create YOUR OWN scenarios, and the overview them and change them while playing with zeus. if you play with a few people and you keep changing the missio maker you never ever ever run out of ideas/scenarios to play.

-Versitilititititiy: I think we've bee here before... With the huge mod support theres other beefits aswell. If you are playing onlie you will be able to find all sorts of server. wether you like playing as a lone wolf and kill other players, play in a huge team vs. AI encampments/bases, or just get flipping rich with selling apples. there's something for everyone out there.

But i don't want to hail everythig into the sky here, so here's a few negatives, which imo you should kow before you buy this:

-This game is in NO regards something for people lookig for a run & gun game. It's a Mil Sim after all.
-With the milsim aspect comes the complication of finding key bindings for everything you want to be able to do. so be preapared to learn buttloads of them (Especially with TFAR and ace in play).
-The graphics may look BRILLIANT on a good rig but if you are on minimum specs prepare for some frame problems,
 especially on bigger servers (although i have to say BI optimized a lot with the last few updates)

But other then that i can really just recommend this game if you are into military shooters that own you huge piles of different stuff.

And since my ""N"" key is fucked, here are some Ns for you guys that made it this far: n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n
That should've made up for the missed ones.

76561198030752353,107410,True,0.973724424839019775,"Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that it‚Äôs developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But it‚Äôs even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. 

At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the game‚Äôs complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your ass depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. 

Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3‚Äôs two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as I‚Äôm stuck on one mission that I simply can‚Äôt seem to complete.)

However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves.

Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). I‚Äôm sure there are so many others that I haven‚Äôt even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game.

In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless.

76561198031889408,107410,True,0.958130419254302979,"Been playing ARMA for almost 10 years now. It‚Äôs grown alongside me, and has created some of the most memorable moments I‚Äôve ever experienced in a videogame. It‚Äôs one of those games which, when it finally ‚Äòclicks‚Äô with you, never quite leaves you. You always find yourself going back to it. It‚Äôs not a game which necessarily empowers you like DOOM or Wolfenstein, but the pay-off from successfully pulling off that mission, that flank, that firing solution, that landing, even that single shot, is unparalleled. 

I‚Äôll always remember the moody fog of the APEX Protocol co-op missions as me and my friend crawled through the jungle, silently taking out patrols hunting for us with flashlights dancing in the dark. I‚Äôll always remember finally Escaping from Tanoa after six hours with my mates ‚Äî it felt like a hiking trip by the end. I‚Äôll always remember staying prone in a ghillie suit as a whole platoon of Russians patrolled past my squad, just like in All Ghillied Up. No other game can recreate the thrill or complexity of these memories in an emergent and inherently personal manner. 

My friends and I, after ten years, have talked for hours about that one mission which went so wrong or that incredible shot one of us made across a whole valley, or just how much we associate some terrains like Sahrani or Stratis with our first years as teenagers back at school. ARMA, for me, is an experience equal in its thrills and frustrations as it is in its nostalgia ‚Äî you come to learn these towns, these fields, these roads and valleys and recall them each as affectionately as the other. Sure, things go wrong: a miscommunication is made, a helicopter crashes, the physics engine freaks out, or the server messes up, but most of the time, you‚Äôll laugh through it. 

ARMA is unlike any other game ‚Äî any other experience. I think this ramble has been quite open in displaying just how much it means to me, and how much it will continue to mean to me. I can assure you, if you give it a chance, it will quickly mean as much to you too."

[h1]*I recommend this particularly for its multiplayer.[/h1]

+ Extremely mod friendly; enjoys full support from the Steam Workshop
+ Visuals & environmental design, save for a few issues here and there (i.e. empty buildings), has largely aged well & looks fantastic
+ Employs a deeply challenging level of realism
+ Multiplayer is still very active; boasts a wonderful variety of gameplay & modded servers to choose from
+ Long, content-packed single player campaign; player choices do affect potential endings, as there are several
+ Time control is back from Arma 2; player can speed up the passage of time, which helps SIGNIFICANTLY to combat the monotony of walking/running very long distances between objectives
+ Enormous map/playable area
+ User-created scenarios & a very easy-to-use scenario creator
+ Boasts incredibly varied gameplay mechanics; from piloting/driving myriad vehicles & gunships, to underwater missions, & everything in-between
+ Map & squad mechanics are back; while they may feel clunky to use in a combat scenario, a little practice goes a long way & serves to open up a slew of options on the battlefield

- Sound design is very hit & miss; some weapons sound identical to others, & vehicle sound effects tend to sound strangely muted
- Dialogue is also hit & miss; while I found the voice-acting to be done largely well, some of the dialogue is a bit awful
- Soundtrack often felt cheesy or inappropriate
- Mission pacing often feels very uneven; I felt that it often leaned too far into the realm of the tedious in the interest of realism (shouldn't be a bad thing in theory, but for the pruposes of a video game, it can put players to sleep in some missions)
- The initial learning curve is considerable, & the tutorial felt inadequate overall; mechanics are amazing on paper, but take an inordinate amount of time to master

Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality. There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release.

One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s.

As we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon. We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols. Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower.

There I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower. I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position. But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed.

As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive.

Falling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command. I had done it. I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive.

76561198007471493,107410,True,0.94609987735748291,"Where do I start with Arma 3...

 1st of all, have I played enough of this game? No, not in the slightest. My total playtime (see above) is pathetic in comparison to those around me. I see upwards of 2000, 3000, 4000 hours just looking at the reviews currently. At the time of writing this review, I sit on a measly 61 hours of gameplay, so I am in no way an expert of this game. 

 What I CAN  tell you is that there are moments in that 61 hours of gameplay that I will probably never forget. This game makes you feel things you won't feel in any other shooter. Call of Duty thrives on high adrenaline, rapid paced combat. Battlefield slows it down a bit, but maintains a good balance of action and spacing between engagements. 

 Arma 3 is a completely different ballpark. There is a LOT of spacing between engagements, which adds massive suspense and makes every firefight very, very meaningful. When combat initiates, there is definately adrenaline pumping action, but it's not fast. Combat is very slow, almost methodical (just like real life) but very, very... awesome. Some things that you'll see in an Arma firefight that you will not see anywhere else:
 - Engagements will be very long distance, often hundreds of meters away, especially if you're roaming the hills or open wilderness. Enemies may only be a fleck in your scope, on another hill entirely, several football fields away from you.
 - You often won't know where you're getting shot from if you're taken by surprise. You don't get any indicators that say ""Hey! someone to your left just shot you!"". Instead, you'll be forced to take cover and locate the enemy the old fashioned way: watching and listening.
 - If you get shot, you probably wont have time to react. One or two shots will kill you without much warning.
 - Teamplay is CRUCIAL. Medics, Anti-Tank, Heavy Gunners all have a part to play in their teams success. 
 - Communication on a whole other level. There is a radio/audio system in the game that is essential to a squad's success. Squad leaders will be vocal, squadees must be willing to take orders and communicate with their superioirs. Directions will not be called out like ""LEFT! RIGHT!"" but rather with compass bearings such as ""There's at least 3 of them at... 248""
 - Stand/Crouch/Prone is also at another level entirely. You can also hunch over, stand up super tall, sit down, lean on your side, bend your body left and right etc.. Manipulating these stances and using them to show as little of you as possible may be a key factor on whether you live or die
 - Every move you make has a pro and a con attached to it. Fire your weapon? Might kill someone, but you might also give your position away or get shot as you peak out of cover. Forget to look left? Arma teaches that wherever you don't look, there will be something that kills you.
 - NO HITMARKERS. You have to make your own call as to whether or not the guy you just shot is dead. If you make the wrong call, your squad may advance only for one of them to be shot by a (very much alive) enemy solider
 - Tanks and armored vehicles are terrifying. It's not like Battlefield where a tank shows up, everybody continues their daily routines and hopefully somebody with anti tank weaponry deals with the 15 ton chunk of metal. Armored vehicles are terrifyingly powerful with weapons foot soldiers can only dream of. A whole squad of 20 people will immediately hit the deck if one of them shpws up, hoping that their AT guys can do the job because...
  - You don't respawn back into the heat of battle. You reaspawn in a base in the middle of nowhere and you either have to take a helicopter to meet with your squad, or ""HALO jump"", which teleports you to an exaxct location but 6000 feet up in the sky, forcing you to have to use your parachute to land safely. HALO jumping back into combat is suicide. Big shiny glorified baloons make really, really good target practice. That also means...
  - If you lose that aforementioned anti-tank guy, you're hooped unless someone takes the risk and picks the launcher off his dead body. That is, unless the tank/armored car blows him up before he gets there. Then 20 people are stranded with very little to do, which means...
 - Every life counts.

 The combat is unreal. I remember we had to clear this city of enemies, entirely. It took us upwards of an hour, but  we checked every single building, room by room, until, In the center plaza, there he stood; the last man we had to kill. All the other building were checked, and I saw a head poking out behind this obstacle in the dead center of the city,

 ""I found him!"" I yell over the squad's radio, ""Central Garden, straight north"" I notice he pokes his head around the corner. My assault rifle was depleted.

 I knew I should have packed more flipping ammo.
 
 So I pull out my pistol. Fire, miss, fire, miss, rinse andrepeat. I empty my whole clip and the man is not dead. So I reload, and just start Terminator walking my way towards this guy. Firing every round I have. The guy doesn't poke his head out anymore. One clip exhausted, then another. And another. This guy will not die. I least I'm supressing him. 

 Then he pops around, shoots me once. Dead.

 My squad catches up ""What the hell was all that shooting?!"" the commander expresses.
 
 They grenade him. Dead.

 Wish I'd have thought of that sooner. 

 The medic gives me a nice repair. I borrow some mags off of him. We get on the chopper, talking about how wicked that mission was. We get a new one, something about planting a bomb somewhere.

 At this point the squad has bonded. We knew eachothers names, at least. We just kept talking, getting closer to the LZ, mocking the pilot for driving too low to the ground. We land and immediately, the chopper comes under fire.

 ""RUN! SPREAD OUT!""

 The heli blows up before it can leave. We all die in a blaze of glory.

 And I left the game after that.

 I cannot recommend this game enough."
76561198176296555,107410,True,0.944918155670166016,"I spent several years in the army and I gotta say this game is spot on with the training and atmosphere the military provides. I love how difficult this game is, and I love all of the different features the game provides. It is NOT easy to hit a target with an assault rifle from 300 yards in real life, and this game seems to match that same difficulty. Fatigue is a real thing and it seriously hinders your accuracy in real life...Arma 3 makes you stop and catch your breath if you run too far or carry too much gear, or you will have a hard time hitting your target. Enemies are not stupid and they have great vision. I was engaged by two enemies from about 200 yards away and they were using bushes for cover as well as 3-5 second rushes when moving. The AI is more advanced than the average taliban are in real life. haha :p Given my love for the military and for videogames, this one is definitely one of my favorites of all time :D"
76561198130981093,107410,True,0.943312287330627441,"I'm not into arma anymore, but as you can probably tell from the amount of hours I've spent paying this game; I've had an incredible time.

Most of the hours clocked into this game have been spent on roleplay servers. They were so fun back in the day..people weren't too serious, and neither too silly. It was very balanced, very fun. Very replayable.

But arma ain't all about roleplay, so let's talk about other things:

I'll start with combat mechanics, obviously - as the game is all about fighting lol. 
The combat is ABSOLUTELY FLIPPING GREAT! You got things like bullet drop which keeps you on your game, and other things such as weapons becoming less effective as the bullet travels mid-air..you also have very aweosme-looking postures which you can adopt; from laying prone, to sitting on your bum, to crouching, leaning side-to-side, and all dat weird jazz.

It's also very realistic in that, you can only take 1-5 shots before you die pending on which weapon is used against you and what kind of protective gear you have equipped. This means that you have to be VERY careful in-game, otherwise you might just get shot in the head and die. Personally, I enjoy such hardcore mechanics.
Another hardcore mechanic is how damage taken is based on where you are hit on your body. So if you've been shot in the head, you're likely to take a hell of a lot of damage, and this is where armour becomes a huge importance; without armour, you are as vulnerable as a mouse surrounded by a horde of cats. I shouldn't even need to stress how much you need armour! You can go light, or heavy - your choice. The amount you wear does affect movement speed though, so do be careful of that. It also affects how badass you look; I generally like to go light so I look like a badass mofo who is totally capable of destroying anyone who crosses my path lol. Not only that, but your appearance can also affect how easily an enemy can spot you. So if you have a huge bag on your back, and lightly coloured clothes- you can be sure people will spot you with ease.

So yeah. Useful information there, I know. But I am most certainly not done! We have to talk about the tanks, and the awesome vehicles that can totally blow ur balls off!

In arma, there are about 20 different ground vehicles, all unique in both appearance and purpose. You have a few anti-vehicle tanks, a few anti-people tanks, and a few artillery and anti-air tanks. Personally, I love the artillery....they're like mini nukes lol. 

You also have APPACHI ATTACK HELICTOPERS! I mean who doesn't like that!? And some awesome looking submarines and attack planes..and boats :):)
AND CARS WITH MOUNTED TURRETS ON!

Yeah, long-story-short -- arma has tons of vehicles, all awesome in both appearance and nature. Very useful for committing mass-genocide on dem pesky capitalist NATO forces....mmmm, satisfactory

Also sorry for not listing their names. I no good wit dat :(:(

Arma also has lots of game modes to choose from, so you're not restricted to just playing one gamemode and getting bored after an hour. I believe I've already listed one already; roleplay. Others include but are not limited to(due to custom game modes etc); TDM, KOH, KTF, PLAYER VS AI(forgot the official classification, sorry), 5v5 COMPETITIVE MATCHES (like that csgo competitive game mode), custom zombie modes, and survival modes. There are also singleplayer game modes which you can host, such as Zeus or custom Addons which allow for various different gameplay experiences; which brings me to my next topic...

There are loads of mods available on the steam workshop! From halo mods, to Star Wars, to enhanced combat system and mechanic mods, xcom mods, and various others which add more vehicles, factions, armour/clothing, more ai, etc...

The settings menus are also vast and fleshed out in arma, so you can rest assured that you'll be able to configure almost anything you want. 
The game also doesn't require a very high-tier computer to function nominaly, so lag shouldn't really be a problem; especially if you tune down the graphics via the settings menus a bit.

This'll be the last topic within this review; multiplayer.
Multiplayer is obviously a huge part of the game, as I've briefly mentioned previously(with the game modes). This game is almost solely multiplayer-based, but singleplayer is a thing and can be fun, so don't feel restricted. This game being focused mainly on multiplayer is obviously good for playing with friends. You can have much fun playing with friends online in this game, much fun indeed. Lag can be a problem though, so make sure you have a decent internet connection and don't be disappointed if you can't play with a friend based half way across the world from you :) but personally I feel the devs have really improved connectibility over the passed years in terms of multiplayer. Id say it's currently at its peak.

Check this game out. It's relatively cheap for its value, so I advise such.

Apologies if I've missed some flavourful features or mechanics. I'll definitely be sure to edit this review if anyone comes in screaming at me about how I didn't include ""this and that and this and that and this and that"" lol.

We're on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back. I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing.

I run, my Autorifleman runs, my Medic runs. But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across.

Anybody seen Full Metal Jacket all the way through? Remember the sniper scene?

The marksman takes a round in the leg as we're running and goes down. He then takes two more in the chest. The kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here.
He screams as he's being shot. Crawling, drenched in his own blood.

     Now that I am at almost 730 hours played at the time of this review's initial publication I thought it was time for me to review my favorite game. This is not going to be a typical review where they say something along the lines of ""swam in the air, 79 out of 10 would be break laws of physics again,"" although that has happened to me and it was hilarious. This is going to be an in depth and honest review of Arma 3.

First though, here is some context.

      When Arma 3 first came out in 2013 I was so excited because I had been watching Arma 2 for so long and I was really hyped on the Arma 3 trailers, not that I actually had a good enough computer to play either one of them of course, so I waited until I finally did. I waited for 3 1/2 years watching YouTube videos and wishing that I could have Arma 3, It was sheer torment. All the cool things that people did just made the situation worse: every valiant last stand against zombies that saved the city, every stealth mission that crippled the enemy, and every close air support gun run that saved a convoy that was under threat just made me want Arma 3 more. So, when I finally had a computer that was good enough to play games on it one of the first games that I got was Arma 3.

       Arma 3 was nothing like I had expected it to be, it was better. An entire virtual sandbox for me to do anything I wanted, go anywhere I wanted, and play any way I wanted. It was not like a ""sophisticated Battlefield"" or a ""Call of Duty on steroids"" like I was expecting it to be, or how I was told it was. Arma 3 is just better. Those descriptions don't even remotely do the game justice. The modding support is astounding to say the least, like I said earlier, zombies. The maps are gorgeous, the weapons are wonderfully modeled, and you have a fully customizable character from the face, to the clothes, to the voice. Arma 3 is more than meets the eye, sure it‚Äôs beautiful, but it also has a great deal of depth behind that gorgeous high polygon count tree, and highly reflective water, and I love it to death for it.

       Arma 3 is in some ways the next logical step for somebody who is into the first person shooter genre, you probably don't know what they say about the game but here it is anyway. ""Children play Call of Duty, boys play Battlefield, men play Arma."" I feel like this statement is true, at least on some levels. The Arma series just feels mature to me, and much more refined than Call of Duty or Battlefield as well. They are not games where you can easily be a""Super Duper MACV Recon SOG SEAL Delta Force Green Beret CIA Operator,"" go ""gunz blazin,"" and kill ""all dem dudes over dere."" Although that sometimes works much to my own surprise and amusement. Arma 3 requires at least some modicum of strategy, or my personal favorite, a great big helping of luck to win, or even be good at in some cases, and I think that is good thing, Arma demands that people invest time into.

       Arma 3 has a large amount of multiplayer content that somebody can enjoy, you can play on a life server and rise through the ranks to become whoever you want to be, whether you want to be are a brutal crime lord, or the mayor of the town. The king of the hill servers bring a nice challenge to Arma 3 where you can fight in and against, in a perfect world, a well organized group of players who are trying very diligently to accomplish their objectives in Arma 3's virtual world. I loved Arma so much that I decided to found a unit which can be found here: join.crabsunion.com

The choice really is up to you on what you want to do in the game, and the built in mission maker with the option to add a ""Zeus"" for mission changes on the fly is always a great option. It is fun to play God for a while, and terrorize your friends.

       The singleplayer content of Arma 3 is quite good, I am very much enjoying the new ""Stepping Stone"" campaign, where NATO forces are trying to seize the picturesque island of Malden in an attempt to attain and maintain aerial dominance over the critically important Strait of Gibraltar.The ""Apex Protocol Campaign"" is very well made in my opinion with several missions that make you feel like you really are a ""Super Duper MACV Recon SOG SEAL Delta Force Green Beret CIA Operator."" Another great thing about the Apex Protocol campaign is that it gives you the option of playing it with friends if you so choose, something I wish the other campaigns did as well.

       Many people say that Arma 3 has a steep learning curve and I disagree. You pick up new things very quickly in Arma 3, or at least I do. Arma 3 just has so much to learn that many people think that it is a very difficult game to play when it is not. Almost every time I play Arma 3 I learn something new about the game or how to play it more effectively. It does not matter whether this is some knowledge about how to use Zeus or make mission more effectively, if it is some new tactic for clearing houses, or even if it is a technique on how to get more stable frame rate. Even with my amount of play time, and the amount of videos I have watched on Arma 3, I am still learning new things constantly. I believe that fact alone sets Arma 3 apart from other games.

       Arma 3 is a somewhat underappreciated treasure in the gaming world with endless content and unlimited scenarios to explore and it deserves more publicity than it is getting. I hope that this review was helpful to you and informative as well. Furthermore I hope that it didn‚Äôt bore you to death too much. Anyways, you have a great day now."

76561198057309553,107410,True,0.932174444198608398,"I have owned this game for a number of weeks now and I have been completely hooked. Great game for the more serious war gamer, not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from Call of Duty series which I consider more for the younger gamers anyway.

Arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games, similar to Battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using. You will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10-20 minutes in a single location (sometimes longer, I personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward.

You will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance.

You can not respawn as quickly as you can in CoD if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic.

The graphics are great, the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to.

I recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible (unless doing paintballing or airgunning), and if you do buy the game - I recommend completing the whole VR Tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the Campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game."

August 20th 2019. I was in a Squad of 7 men. I had the duty of a combat life saver. We had to fly oversea's on a Helicopter. I couldn't tell if my pilot was drunk or my dial up internet was making the helicopter do acrobatics but it was intense. About 5 minutes of flying we touch down safely, getting out as my ears immediately explode from my sound mod making the helicopter 5000x louder. It was awesome. We continue down the road for another 200m when a sniper from the treeline blows off one of my boys heads. We all scramble for cover behind the hill. My boy and I had to kill the MMG who were suppressing our men. We take a flank to the left in hopes of gunning this asshole down. Because the AI are fucking superman, me and my boy were immediately spotted and suppressed by sniper fire behind a rock. He gets hit in the chest which caused a velocity wound and other medical wounds. I sew him up like the god I am and we continue down the hill under all sorts of fire. I take a bullet to my arm and leg, making me as slow as a 60 year old asthmatic hippo with 3 legs. I stitch up my wounds and began limping to some more cover. I fix my leg somehow and im mobile again, pushing into the objective we were supposed to take an hour ago. Our NATO squad successfully raided the base. Only 2 men were killed and all CSAT have been eliminated.

Or so we thought.

The man on the radio sounds like his balls dropped off Mount Everest. He tells us CSAT reinforcements will be arriving shortly. I was unprepared with only 3 mags of ammunition and only a few medical bandages and morphine left. After a few minutes of respite, a shot is echoed from the hills and another firefight takes place again. These assholes now have armored cars with .50 guns on them. 4 of our men are killed within seconds. Thankfully i brought AT rockets with me and I take out the armored car. It explodes in a fiery mess, leaving that area scorched. My boy and I take cover behind a shitty jeep as more and more bullets fly over our heads. He gets hit in the chest 2 times and in the leg 3. I'm out of ammunition in both weapons and I am forced to drag him behind a tree. I take a hit to my chest and start to bleed out. Medical supplies are running thin. 

A few minutes passed and the CSAT have stopped firing. They probably thought we all died. I failed to medic my friend as his cold, dead body lay in the grass. I scavenge off my dead teammates for ammo, leaving my aim in the garbage due to the multiple wounds to the arms. Just when I thought all was over, a NATO chopper has came to evacuate me. I have a blood pressure of the exact definition of trash, my heart rate is 50 and my screen is black and white. I'm limping up a hill while taking multiple shots from the CSAT hiding in the thick brush. I am able to get into the chopper and escape as the last man in my squad to live. 

From that day on, I have diagnosed myself with PTSD. Only play if your balls are made of titanium."

[h1]Price Breakdown[/h1]
Full price of the game and all DLC without deals or bundles $200.25

With my 4,000 hours of gameplay that equates to
 $0.0502375 an hour of playtime (Or about 5 cents)

 $0.15181956027293404094010614101592 a day (Or about 15 cents)


Arma is a near future military sandbox experience that gives players access to play how they want, whether they want to be infantry, tank operators, war journalists, helicopter pilots, jet pilots, boat captains, divers. Arma has something to suit any players wants.

[h1]Are the DLCs worth it?[/h1]
So when we're looking at value it is well worth it. I often run into people going on in lobbies about how Arma is always bringing out DLCs that cost way too much for what they are and that Bohemia is just a moneyhungering company, but when you break it down the level of detail they bring to the table and the time you spend on the content is unparalleled in terms of replayability. Aside from the singleplayer campaigns and the maps introduced in DLCs all of the content is actually free to use whether you own the DLC or not, the only downside is that if you do use something that you don't own the DLC for then a watermark will show up on the side of your screen for a few seconds every five to ten minutes or so.

It seems that in many peoples eyes the most cardinal sins are the Contact DLC and Laws of War DLC. But I only ever hear complaints about them from people that when I get into debates with them they say 'Oh, I forgot Arma had a singleplayer."" or ""Pfffft, no one plays the singleplayer."" But this last statement couldn't be more wrong. In fact in terms of parts of this game that shine, the singleplayer campaigns and missions are a big part of that.

[h1]Singleplayer[/h1]
The way the tutorial seemlessly blends into the story of the larger campaign, to the political turmoil you find yourself being embroiled in, to the intrigue of the moral dilemmas you find yourself asking at the end of the Laws of War campaign. These stories are memorable! If you ever dip your hands in the Zeus gamemode (the veritable Dungeons and Dragons of the Armaverse) you'll often find yourself recreating some of those memorable experiences for other players, such as the uneasy downtime and that suspenseful few moments before a major gunfight.

[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]
If singleplayer isn't your thing then the multiplayer will keep you coming back again and again, whether you want to have a PVP killfest in King of the Hill, a PVE mission based gamemode in Invade and Annex or Antistasi, the aforementioned Zeus gamemode, a roleplay experience in ArmaLife servers, or a hardcore military simulation. Arma has it all. When it comes to the multiplayer, most of my most enjoyable moments have been the downtime in between missions, whether chilling at the base or traveling to the area of operations. Arma multiplayer is a social experience at heart and that's where the multiplayer experience really shines in my eyes. I have met many people over the years that I am still good friends with to this day, and I have Arma to thank for that. We have had good times together and even better stories to tell. When I was first playing this game I didn't have a microphone so I had to type everything I wanted to get across, because of that I inadvertently learnt touch typing, which is pretty strange to say when someone asks you how you learnt to touch type. The official servers can become quite chaotic, but if you find a nice server a community is hosting then that can be like a second home, even with some of the chaotic people in the official servers the community as a whole is the most welcoming community I've come across in a game.

[h1]Community[/h1]
Touching on the community, Arma has a strong and committed modding and content creation community, mainly due to the passion of the users and the easy to use modding and mission creation tools, such as the 3DEN editor, a 3d mission maker contained within the game itself which harkens back to the golden age of Real Time Strategy games, such as Age of Empires. So if what you want to do isn't quite in the game, you're sure to find a mod or a mission that allows you to do that and if you can't there is an abundance of information on how to make it yourself. And with the easeability of sharing modlists, it's easy to bundle all of the mods you need to make the experience you want to play and then share the list with your mates so that you can all play together.

[h1]Is Arma The Game For You?[/h1]
All in all there is a lot of downtime in this game, so if you're all about instant gratification, killstreaks and being the best of the best then this game probably isn't for you. Arma is a team game and a lot of the game is spent walking, travelling or planning which gives you a lot of time to get to know your team. So if you're not into that then this might not be the game for you when it comes to the multiplayer. If you're looking for a game that is a million different games however, Arma is for you. Because every experience is different and with mods it can even be an entirely different game, for an example just look at DayZ or PlayersUnknownBattlegrounds which both started their lives as mods on Arma.

First off, the campaign for single player is ok, but not great. You will be able to find other games with better campaign story modes than ARMA III as the main focus is put on the Multiplayer aspect. However, the campaign and story does prove challenging and the story is solid enough to keep you entertained and engaged. 

Secondly, The DLC content is hit or miss. 

GOOD DLC!
-Tanks add several new tanks into the game and make putting a AP round through your enemy a joy!
-Jets add several new jets to wreak havoc with! It also adds a aircraft carrier!
-Marksman adds some of the best sniper rifles in the game period! Also adds several ghillie suits and scopes. 

Decent DLC.
-Helicopters adds two helis to the game. Mostly for heavy lifting. 
-APEX adds an Island called Tanoa. A dozen weapons and gear. A few vehicles and a few VTOL aircraft. 

Bad DLC!
-Karts. Go-karts on a battlefield. Is this a joke?
-Laws of War. A single player mini campaign for a multiplayer focused game.  Not worth your money.
- Tac-Ops. Again, another single player mini campaign in a multiplayer focused game. Not worth your money.

Third on the list in multiplayer. The true fun to be had with ARMA III is through the multiplayer. There are 1000's of servers all with different options to chose from fitting nearly every type and style of game play. Zombies, they got it. Not into Zombies? No problem. Co-op, yep! Role play, check! Survival, you bet! PvP for those that like to kill others and PvE for the more casual crowd can be found.

Fourth. The community of players found in ARMA III are some of the best I have seen. They are often found to be helpful and willing to lend a hand to newer players and also to veterans in need of assistance. With that being said, you will however run into the occasional troublemaker, rule breaker, or very rarely a hacker. Most of them are dealt with swiftly by the server admins. Then, also,  there is those few players who have little time to read the server rules and blindly run off into the battlefield annoying players by doing things they shouldn't. When corrected by others, they will usually reply "" I didn't know the rules. "" A word of advice. When entering a server, read the rules or simply ask in chat and other players will usually be happy to explain them. 

Fifth, the graphics. For a game that is over 5 years old, the graphics are good. Not great mind you, but good to say the least. 

Sixth, the game play. ARMA III focuses on two things. Realistic militarised game play and multiplayer action via servers. Most of the servers run mods created by people like you and me. Some are about survival and will have you scrounging the map for supplies and gear. Some are about playing team death-match. Some are co-op missions. They can be very fun and can add a lot of vehicles, maps, gear, aircraft, weapons, scenarios, and more to the game. However, no one is prefect and you will find yourself dead periodically after simply opening a door, walking down stairs, entering a vehicle, exiting a vehicle, etc. The point is, expect the unexpected. While this does not happen all the time, you most definitely will encounter a few bugs and glitches from time to time. The most common and frustrating is the sudden vanishing of vehicles left at your base. ARMA loves to eat vehicles for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Also, it will eat your gear, weapons, base, and well....pretty much anything.  So don't get too attached to your stuff. As a server admin for several different servers, I have spent entire days replacing lost items. However, do not expect all admins to be as accommodating as losing items in ARMA is all part of the game.

In all, ARMA III can be a very fun game to play. It's strength comes from the almost limitless ways the game can be played on the 1000's of available servers. After all this time, I still find myself spending the weekends running missions on several servers. In the end, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes realistic military style games."

76561198019130249,107410,False,0.92248910665512085,"Right before i get started - I was a massive fan of the Arma series and have been for 10+ years, it is the reason i bought my first gaming PC.

311 days ago i was Developer banned from Arma 3. The day before i received this ban i had decided to download arma after months away from it. I downloaded the game, it remembered all my mods, downloaded them then i fired the game up.

Do you lads feel out of sorts some times and you sit looking at you vast steam library wondering what to play. Its kinda like choosing a film on Netflix, before you know it times up and you cant be bothered. It was like that. I sat in the in game menu for one minute (screen shot to prove it) before deciding not to play. I exited the game, steam and shut down my PC. 

The following day i decided i was going to fully get back into it. I loaded up my computer. Steam automatically opened but this time with a message. You have been banned from the following games (ARMA 3).

It stated i was banned by the developer. I immediately thought why the hell was i banned. I contacted BI within ten minutes. The response was the same as it remains today. 'we do not deal with bans, battleye do. Please contact battleye if you need support with a ban.' 

BUT YOU DO DEAL WITH BANS - THIS IS A DEV BAN NOT A BE BAN????

I spent the last 10 months contacting BE who eventually responded to tell me that they did not ban me nor did they find anything on my PC that was suspicious to them at the time of my ban. They informed my my logs were 'spotless'

I swung my attention back around to BI. I contacted them the other day. A chap called Dominik responded saying the ban was a battleye ban not a DEV ban.  I have since sent him images of my ban stating it was a DEV ban, steams explanation of a DEV BAN which states a developer informs valve of an account that is suspicious and valve ban them. I have sent images of my conversation with BE and proof that in the two weeks before my ban i had one minute of game time which was spent in the menu. 

The emails have fallen of deaf ears.....No response from Dominik. 

I am absolutely heart broken that from the past 10 months i have been unable to play with my friends and it looks like this situation is not going to change. I am disgusted as the lack of acknowledgement and willingness to support and resolve this from BI. 

I have so many fond memories in Arma 2, OH & 3 but it looks like this is the end of the road for me. I will miss the random chats in game, the communities i was part of and the battles of the field. 

You never know, if you guys blow this up they might just let me back :)"

76561198061912275,107410,True,0.910561800003051758,"Arma 3 is like that long-term girlfriend/boyfriend you date where, at the honeymoon phase, you are smitten and are like ""wow, this is a 10/10 unique experience."" However, as the months turn to years and time rolls on, you start to realize there are shinier, prettier experiences out there- better looks, sexier moves, more stable, but you stick with it. You realize you're really with a solid 7/10, but **** is it fun. There are things he/she can do that no one else can, and well, despite deviations time to time to fantasize about other experiences, and several on-again/off-again times spent dabbling in those fantasies, you find yourself coming back to him/her. You find yourself truly happy...even after the worst (and unstable) times. Come to think of it, maybe this isn't a healthy relationship, but at the end of the day, it's a **** fun one.

Arma is an unstable, buggy ride and a bit overwhelming on first impressions, but it's an experience that you don't get in any other sandbox game or military shooter. The community is really what drives this game. It's a quasi-sim/quasi-arcade experience that can be tailored to the community/user's need given a little time spent learning how it all works. The developers do a decent job of providing documentation to understand how content creation and mission editing functions, and the community fills (and exceeds) the areas unfulfilled and self-imagined. There are few communities as diverse and robust as Arma's. In one night's events, you can go from playing a modern-day military sim night with your homies, to WWII, Vietnam, then Star Wars, Halo, Starship Troopers, Aliens, to the bloody revolutionary war and more. In short, Arma should be judged more as a sandbox & framework for community addons than a game on its own, and one that over the last 6 years developed into being highly accessible to the average user without even needing to touch a text editor or understand how it works to get custom games going through its implementation of a ""Dungeon Master"" style mission builder called ""Zeus."" Arma's experience varies greatly depending on your level of tolerance for troubleshooting and patience with searching/installing addons. 

This is best experienced by being dragged in by a community of friends... really it's kind of Stockholm Syndrome that kept me in it to start, and the incredible, fun, sometimes frustrating, and hilarious experiences made along the way is something no other game has offered and keeps me coming back. Give it a go, or watch some communities stream their experiences and see for yourself."

76561197979139992,107410,True,0.908434510231018066,"Well after playing this game for a few hours I thought it was about time to write a review.

I struggle to think of many games past or present that manage to do what Arma 3 does. Before the impending praise I'm about to give this game I will say 2 things. 

First, there will be bugs. Not the Starship Troopers kind... Well actually you can kill bugs as a Starship Trooper but I'm talking glitches, rubber banding, inventory issues, layer upon layer of mods causing compatibility issues and the list goes on. You simply have to embrace these problems and make them part of the enemy which you have to overcome! If you are easily put off by the above, Arma isnt for you, in fact the way games are pushed out these days a don't think many games would be for you.

Second, so far I have spent ¬£150 on this game (not including money spent on my own private server endeavours and donations to other public server communities) which sounds and is slightly ridiculous HOWEVER I have spent over 6000 hours on this game which is more than the rest of my steam library combined so as a time spent versus money paid its the cheapest game I've ever bought. All I say to anyone who somehow doesn't own it yet is wait for a Steam super sale and buy everything in one nice discount and your laughing!

The above remain the only 2 reasons I would not recommend this game, price Inc all dlc and the constant battle with bugs etc. All that aside Arma 3 is simply one of the best things you can buy for your PC. From the seemingly infinite Steam Workshop content to the fact that you can do anything from Milsim team based combat to simple PvP to cooperative missions to RPG style game modes to racing mods and a small off shoot you may have heard of called DayZ (Arma 2 mod but ya know what I'm getting at) it really does tick every box. There is a huge learning curve in the form of keybindings. It takes time just finding the right section to rebind keys but once you are comfortable I find the control of your character, chopper, jet, quad bike, humvee, tank, golf caddy etc quite intuitive. No other game gives you as many stances to be in. You can literally find a stance which gives you line of sight through a small hole in a wall at any angle. There are basic and advanced settings for flying so you can feel like a pro or take it easy with simplified physics and controls.

One final word... Community! As with all games you are bound to find trolls and people too competitive to remember what manners are, however on the whole Arma has a great community of players. I play 90% coop missions these days and it is just a breath of fresh air to be playing multiplayer on such a grand scale without this furious and frantic atmosphere which is so prominent in most multilayer games these days. After the demise of the Battlefield franchise after BC2 and BF3 I really needed a game to fill my need for military shooters and Arma 3 came to my rescue.

Rather than go on and on, all I will end on saying is that this game is more like a template for you to then decide what you actually want to spend your time doing. If you are on the fence, browse the workshop and see the sheer amount of 5 star community made content from overhaul mods to subtle quality of life mods. You could spend 6000 hours just playing all the single player campaigns made by other users."

Crowd around, children, it's story time.

One day, not so long ago, my squad had just destroyed an anti-air battery. Our pilot landed, and the rest of the squad boarded one by one. I was about to get in when the rockets started flying.

The chopper lifted off, with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes. Unwilling to die before then, I rushed to the nearest cover, a small house by a narrow road. I entered to find a ten year-old player who had also been left behind. He explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his ""clan"".

I politely declined, explaining that my own squad was inbound. As I finished, a Ghost Hawk flew over the horizon. My squad had arrived.

This noble child soldier and I were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting. The sniper screamed as a 6.5 mm cartridge entered his leg. His shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as I climbed in the transport.

My new friend was dead.

Grossly outdated graphics engine, poorly optimised, it remains the closest game you can ever play to the real thing. During its heyday, milsim communities and modders made this more of an experience than some simple combat simulator - I was able to don exactly the same equipment, uniform and loadouts that I served with while in the army.
NOT worth it if you're playing vanilla arma - terrifying and immersive if you use mods.
You can eat, climb walls, abseil, drink, splint fractures, dress burns, dig foxholes, engage in melee, interrogate, be suppressed and find yourself in a house being breached and cleared by the enemy.

76561197971414496,107410,True,0.896043360233306885,"Arma 3 is a tricky game to review, but here‚Äôs me trying it anyway.

The reason why this game is so hard to review lies in the sheer size of the game and the variety of things it may or may not offer for the player.

I take Arma 3 for what it is first and foremost: a platform. What you get is a good looking game with a solid (would be great, but you have to do some optimization to boost your performance) engine, two amazing maps (Stratis and Altis, which is probably the most impressive map I‚Äôve seen in any open world-ish game) and the prospect of near endless new content from the community.

What you don‚Äôt get is an easy to get into mil-shooter with CoD sized maps and a quick pace. If you‚Äôre in for uncomplicated, fast paced PvP gameplay, you should probably look elsewhere. If you‚Äôre sick of that, however, Arma 3 might be just your thing. 

The strength of the Arma series is freedom (**** yeah). You are free to mod the game into almost anything you want, create any type of mission and make your very own gameplay experience. You have to invest some time into the game, but once you got into it, the opportunities are endless.

Want to play huge adversial or coop maps with a hundred players or more?  Arma is just your thing and there are big communities (in many different languages) that will help you find that epic experience.

Want to play singe player? Well, if you expect strong single player content with interesting characters and storyline and so on, then Arma 3 isn‚Äôt the game you‚Äôre looking for.  Or is it? Right now Bohemia delivered one part of a three part campaign ‚Äì those missions are challenging, offer a solid variety of infantry gameplay but don‚Äôt expect a good story or interesting characters. But as mentioned before ‚Äì the huge amount of community made missions and mods offer hours and hours of playtime.

Personally I prefer small cooperative missions to play with friends. Already the steam workshop has countless missions for 2-5 players. 

So, should you buy Arma 3? Well, I‚Äôd certainly recommend it, if any of the things I mentioned above sounds fun to you. It is to say though, that this game is not something that everyone might like, so stay away from it if you are not willing to invest some time into it.

I hope that this review helped some people to decide whether or not they should by Arma 3. Please note that I‚Äôm not a native English speaker, so the language used in this review might seem a little odd for some."

Briefly, I remember that every single second I've played this game is my favorite memory. As I do so, the developer's splash screen flashes on the screen, followed by the warm  welcome of the ARMA III logo and subsequent main menu screen. In this moment, I feel happy and fulfilled. The events of the real world bear no importance to me as I undertake the task of deciding what I'm going to get myself into today. Shall it be Altis life antics? Do I recreate the Osama Bin Laden raid with my friends? Should I attempt to put myself into the shoes of a Marine in the middle of the Tet Offensive of late 1968? My mind wanders into the child-like curiosity and the uncertainty of the events that will take place tonight, and therefore I am excited. This is my conscious mind.

76561198061699977,107410,True,0.889143705368041992,"[h1] The Big A3 [/h1]

[b] Welcome to Arma 3: The Big One [/b]

If you didn't just start PC gaming an hour ago, you've probably heard of Arma 3. Every time someone says the names Call of Duty, Battlefield, Squad, Red Orchestra, Verdun, or any other shooter title out there, they do so in hushed tones and with their hands over their mouths for fear of the inevitable tongue-lashing they're about to receive from an Arma fan.
Fans of the Arma series are fiercly loyal and totally uncompromising. I have little doubt you've heard the following phrases:

[list]
[*]""If you want [i] realism, [/i] you should play Arma.""
[*]""Only casuals play. . . .""
[*]""Arma 3 is way better because . . . .  and  . . . . ""
[/list]

It's annoying and inarguably elitist but, in their defense, also mostly true. Arma 3 is not for someone who is looking for a casual shooter experience. Arma 3 is for those of us that want to camp out in the trees, waiting for the three guys you saw 30 minutes before, and hoping you can pull of a successful ambush quickly, quietly, and without getting hit. Then, walking for another 30 minutes to link up with another squad, grab some vehicles, and truck a few kilometers out to set up a new FOB. You can expect to go upwards of 3 hours without firing a shot on certain servers.

Which brings me to my next point. . . 

[b] The Game Within a Game Within a Game Within a Game. . . . [/b]

One of A3's major selling points is it's massive, active, dedicated, and diverse community of modders. Arma 3 has a great single player campaign and a few nice King of the Hill and Wasteland servers that you will want to visit occasionally, but Arma gets particularly interesting when you go mod shopping. 

in the mood to lose track of 30 hours while you're dodging police officers and rival gangs as you fight to expand your criminal empire across Altis and/or Tanoa?
Asylum 'Life' servers are a personal favorite of mine. Complete with a living, player-driven economy, impactful politics between gangs and a police force trying to keep control of the island as these gangs throw lead and shade at one another in a constant struggle for turf. If that sounds familiar to you, make no mistake, GTA V doesn't come close to touching the complexity of Life servers.

There are mods for different eras of warfare, gamemodes for about anything you can imagine, and you can find most of them on Steam Workshop, making it easy to access and giving you infinite playtime. You literally cannot run out of things to do because there is [i] always [/i] more content.

I could honestly write about Arma all evening but I'll leave you with a few pros and cons and then I'll wrap things up for you.

[b] PROS: [/b]
[list]
[*]Infinite play value, you can never run out of content
[*]satisfying and memorable moments come to those with patience
[*]game modes for almost everything thanks to the modding community
[*]great graphics for excellent immersion
[*]Endless selection of weapons, vehicles, gear, etc.
[*]Shed your 'casual' title and pick up the mark of 'master' gamer
[/list]

[b] CONS: [/b]
[list]
[*]Arma 3 is not well optimized and is very CPU intensive. Still perfectly playable at 30fps though you will need a high end i7 if you expect to get anywhere near 60fps on most multiplayer servers. AMD users be warned.
[*]Seriously not for casual gamers. I cannot stress this enough. It can take hours to accomplish simple goals depending on your game mode. Highly satisfying when things come together, though.
[*]Expect to move slowly while learning controls. Arma 3 is a game that uses just about [i] all [/i] of your keyboard and it will take you a while to master.

[b] But Should I Buy It? [/b]

I can't recommend this game enough. But if you're a die-hard Call of Duty fan but you still pick up this title, you're in for a rude awakening. Casual gamers be warned."
76561198072447858,107410,True,0.889115750789642334,"What did you do today? I did walk into a stopsign and died in Arma 3.
Meh.. After 3099 hours and 15000 deaths later it's still a game you will return back to.
Thumbsup all the way."
76561198026803446,107410,True,0.888425886631011963,Just buy it. Look at how many hours I have in this game. It's the best money you'll ever spend. It is all things to all gamers.
76561197995591955,107410,True,0.88792949914932251,"Can't tell you if you should buy it or not, but I can tell you this.
You will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isn't there and lack of content if you're not satisfied with what you have. 
But when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, it's something magical you just can't find in any other game.

Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly.
Arma is a game which you can never called finished. There will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations. 

Hope I expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :)

If you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem!

I'll give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, I've used hundreds of hours on Arma 3 that I would never take back.

Now, some people don't care much for the realism, and prefer action-movie esque shooters. That's fine. However, this game shines at gritty realistic firefights. There's nothing glorious about shouting contact reports into the radio, bounding cover to cover, and hoping the next round doesn't have your name on it, but when you're finally back on the bird with your buddies headed home, and you finally feel the sense of relief wash over you.

76561198229080732,107410,True,0.882169544696807861,"Had this game for over 2 years now, and over 4000 hours played.

I have to admit, if you decide to start getting in depth with this game, it will be hard to stop depenending in which gamemode you play on. Life servers =Your done. Once you start progressing from rank to rank you'd never want to stop. This game is amazing, but very addictive to the point where someone like me has 4k hours on it."
76561198049422365,107410,True,0.882125139236450195,"Being an avid ArmA 2 Wasteland/DayZ player back in the day (about 1.5 years ago), I relished the thought of a new ArmA coming out. ArmA 2 was practically uknown until it's popularity was increased by DayZ. I found it interesting to jump into a BI (Bohemia Interactive) title that already had a steady fan-base behind it. Having been about a year since I purchased this game (launch) and over 100 hours of solid gameplay I feel that I can finally write a review that encompasses many of the aspects I have experienced within this game. Now I know what you're thinking: ""$59.99?! This isn't even considered a triple A title! That's like... that's like the price of CoD: Ghosts!"" Now, don't be intimidated by this price, for I can say that off the bat this game is worth a lot more than $59.99. From a value perspective, I found the price to be very reasonable based on the game's content nowadays.

Basically, ArmA is a series of hardcore military simulation; constantly reflecting real-world conditions into a video game. In ArmA 2, I feel that this was it's drawback, for there were certain scenarios where it was realistic to a point of frustration (breaking your leg on a 2 foot fall. It's a game guys, relax). ArmA 3 has found a good balance between an FPS/3rd Person shooter game and realism, making it extremely enjoyable as both a simulator [i] and [/i] a game. I also found that ArmA 3 has very good support for newbies to the series and is able to really engage players into the fun. I imagine it is much easier to get into ArmA 3 than I did ArmA 2 (I can't judge, I'm not new to it). 

The engine is decently optimized and is far less clunkier than the ArmA 2 engine, however rocks are still (and I guess forever will be) broken. Perhaps the game is having difficulty conforming such free player movement with an un-even surface. 

Pro tip: NEVER WALK ON ROCKS UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.

The game also has a variety of content; although players coming over from 2 will notice that there are A LOT less guns. This is partly due to the customization of guns. Instead of having a separate gun for each gun variation (M4A1 HOLO, M4A1 CCO, M4A1) you have a base gun and you are able to add sights, lasers, silencers, flashlights, what have you. However, this is not a full excuse- I feel that there are still a lesser amount of overall GUNS to shoot. Perhaps Bohemia Interactive is trying to fine-tune each gun into the patches as opposed to adding a ton of mediocre weapons simply for variety's sake. What's also very surprisingly good in this game is the Nvidia PhysX that was incorporated. Seeing my transport truck's wheels constantly bumping up and down according to the land under me while I drive troops through the night is oh-so-satisfying as well as, well... realistic! The physics engine has been extremely improved and I quite like it.

I'd like to finally talk about how the guns shoot and how they sound, for this is after all, a big part of the game. Once again I will compare it to ArmA 2, in saying clearly that ArmA 2 featured a more high-pitched ""tappy"" sound when you shot with vertical recoil, while 3 brings a much more deeper, louder shot as well as echo to accompany it as the gun travels backwards into your viewmodel as opposed to upwards. The guns definitely feel better for me, but in the end I'd like to classify this judgment as personal preference.

Lastly, the gamemodes of ArmA 3 are diverse and excellent, my favourite being Wasteland script. I won't go into detail here. There is also King of Hill, DayZ (OF COURSE, but it's MEH) and of course standard operations. Altis Life is also a really sweet one! Check those out if you end up buying.

So yeah, I really like this game and I think that there is so much potential for a growing community. Grab some buddies, hop into Stratis and keep overwatch with some snipers and riflers as you and your team move in through the bushes to grab an objective for more supplies for your squad! Really great game, I'd definitely recommend to any FPS/MILSIM fan! :D"

76561197963644421,107410,True,0.881744086742401123,"If you're coming to Arma 3 as an Arma series veteran, you already know what to expect. For the most part, the game hasn't changed since the last installment, but then it's always felt a little bit like Bohemia Interactive are still building on the groundwork laid back in 2001 by Operation Flashpoint, in the world's longest ever game of 'development Buckaroo'. Thankfully, the whole thing has yet to fall to pieces in any significant manner; it's quite happy to continue wobbling uneasily for now.

Arma has a reputation. It's known to be frighteningly obtuse, bewilderingly complex, and often hilariously broken. I can tell you right now that Arma 3 is no different, and absolutely still deserves that reputation. Thankfully, I don't think it's unfair to say that this is the closest an Arma game has come to being 'user friendly'. The controls have been tweaked, and the interface refined a little to accommodate more modern tastes. For these improvements alone, I do recommend it to newcomers to the series over any previous entry.
Coming from any other modern FPS game, it will still take a good few hours of what can feel an awful lot like hard work to get to grips with the controls, but I honestly think Arma 3 will see a far lower 'drop-out rate' of newbies who were frustrated to the point of giving up by the previous games.

At the time of writing, the elephant in the room is the lack of content available. When compared to Arma 2 (which is handsomely bolstered by an array of official expansion packs), the amount of hardware available to play with is frustratingly slim. In many cases, opposing armies are equipped with identical vehicles which get a slightly different paint job at best. For anyone used to the myriad of variants and oddments available in Arma 2, Arma 3 can feel awfully disappointing.
Fortunately, this is alleviated to some extent by the strong mod community. It has long been the case that the best parts of the Arma games are the parts not developed by Bohemia Interactive themselves, and Arma 3 is most definitely continuing this 'tradition'. Nevertheless, I can't help but feel that the game could've done with a few months more time in the oven before full public release.

Speaking of the mod community, I think it's criminal that almost none of the best, near-indispensible mods from Arma 2 have been officially integrated. For a self-professed 'war simulator', Arma 3 is hugely lacking in basic features like being able to rest your weapon on surfaces (even with a visible bipod), or tow damaged vehicles.

For all its flaws, though, Arma 3 is still a blast to play. If you can find a decent group of like-minded gamers with access to a voice-over-net server, you're in for some of the best gaming you'll ever experience. Sure, you'll probably have to load up on mods to satisfy your need for variety. And sure, sometimes the game will crash spectacularly, or the physics engine will flip out and kill you for standing too close to a wall. But when you're standing on a hilltop, looking out over an enemy outpost with your squadmates while a CAS helicopter strafes an enemy APC and spots targets for a distant sniper team; when everything clicks together in the way that only Arma can manage, you'll be glad to have been along for the ride."

76561198019977288,107410,True,0.875654399394989014,"I don't know where to start with this but let's just try:

My first experience with ArmA was with the Operation Flashpoint Series and later on with ArmA 1 (Cold war Assault) and then ArmA 2 (+ all possible Add-Ons).
And i just have to say, that i freakin fell in love with this game (ArmA3) from the very begining.

Sure there were heaves of problems, bugs and shit going wrong at the beginning but i still bought this game as soon as it was availabe (Which should've been like early Alpha or so).

But to explain why i sank over propably 2000 hours of my life into this game:

-Versatility: With the workshop added and all the mod support the game offers, it's just incredible for how long you are able to find new stuff. New Maps, weapons, uniforms, AI-Units, vehicles, helicopers, tanks, etc. etc.

-Versitility: With the ZEUS Modul and the Ed3n Editor you are able to creato soooooo much stuff. You can create YOUR OWN scenarios, and the overview them and change them while playing with zeus. if you play with a few people and you keep changing the missio maker you never ever ever run out of ideas/scenarios to play.

-Versitilititititiy: I think we've bee here before... With the huge mod support theres other beefits aswell. If you are playing onlie you will be able to find all sorts of server. wether you like playing as a lone wolf and kill other players, play in a huge team vs. AI encampments/bases, or just get flipping rich with selling apples. there's something for everyone out there.

But i don't want to hail everythig into the sky here, so here's a few negatives, which imo you should kow before you buy this:

-This game is in NO regards something for people lookig for a run & gun game. It's a Mil Sim after all.
-With the milsim aspect comes the complication of finding key bindings for everything you want to be able to do. so be preapared to learn buttloads of them (Especially with TFAR and ace in play).
-The graphics may look BRILLIANT on a good rig but if you are on minimum specs prepare for some frame problems,
 especially on bigger servers (although i have to say BI optimized a lot with the last few updates)

But other then that i can really just recommend this game if you are into military shooters that own you huge piles of different stuff.

And since my ""N"" key is fucked, here are some Ns for you guys that made it this far: n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n
That should've made up for the missed ones.

76561198030752353,107410,True,0.973724424839019775,"Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that it‚Äôs developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But it‚Äôs even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. 

At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the game‚Äôs complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your ass depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. 

Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3‚Äôs two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as I‚Äôm stuck on one mission that I simply can‚Äôt seem to complete.)

However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves.

Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). I‚Äôm sure there are so many others that I haven‚Äôt even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game.

In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless.

It‚Äôs grown alongside me, and has created some of the most memorable moments I‚Äôve ever experienced in a videogame. It‚Äôs one of those games which, when it finally ‚Äòclicks‚Äô with you, never quite leaves you. You always find yourself going back to it. It‚Äôs not a game which necessarily empowers you like DOOM or Wolfenstein, but the pay-off from successfully pulling off that mission, that flank, that firing solution, that landing, even that single shot, is unparalleled. 

I‚Äôll always remember the moody fog of the APEX Protocol co-op missions as me and my friend crawled through the jungle, silently taking out patrols hunting for us with flashlights dancing in the dark. I‚Äôll always remember finally Escaping from Tanoa after six hours with my mates ‚Äî it felt like a hiking trip by the end. I‚Äôll always remember staying prone in a ghillie suit as a whole platoon of Russians patrolled past my squad, just like in All Ghillied Up. No other game can recreate the thrill or complexity of these memories in an emergent and inherently personal manner. 

My friends and I, after ten years, have talked for hours about that one mission which went so wrong or that incredible shot one of us made across a whole valley, or just how much we associate some terrains like Sahrani or Stratis with our first years as teenagers back at school. ARMA, for me, is an experience equal in its thrills and frustrations as it is in its nostalgia ‚Äî you come to learn these towns, these fields, these roads and valleys and recall them each as affectionately as the other. Sure, things go wrong: a miscommunication is made, a helicopter crashes, the physics engine freaks out, or the server messes up, but most of the time, you‚Äôll laugh through it. 

ARMA is unlike any other game ‚Äî any other experience. I think this ramble has been quite open in displaying just how much it means to me, and how much it will continue to mean to me. I can assure you, if you give it a chance, it will quickly mean as much to you too."

[h1]*I recommend this particularly for its multiplayer.[/h1]

+ Extremely mod friendly; enjoys full support from the Steam Workshop
+ Visuals & environmental design, save for a few issues here and there (i.e. empty buildings), has largely aged well & looks fantastic
+ Employs a deeply challenging level of realism
+ Multiplayer is still very active; boasts a wonderful variety of gameplay & modded servers to choose from
+ Long, content-packed single player campaign; player choices do affect potential endings, as there are several
+ Time control is back from Arma 2; player can speed up the passage of time, which helps SIGNIFICANTLY to combat the monotony of walking/running very long distances between objectives
+ Enormous map/playable area
+ User-created scenarios & a very easy-to-use scenario creator
+ Boasts incredibly varied gameplay mechanics; from piloting/driving myriad vehicles & gunships, to underwater missions, & everything in-between
+ Map & squad mechanics are back; while they may feel clunky to use in a combat scenario, a little practice goes a long way & serves to open up a slew of options on the battlefield

- Sound design is very hit & miss; some weapons sound identical to others, & vehicle sound effects tend to sound strangely muted
- Dialogue is also hit & miss; while I found the voice-acting to be done largely well, some of the dialogue is a bit awful
- Soundtrack often felt cheesy or inappropriate
- Mission pacing often feels very uneven; I felt that it often leaned too far into the realm of the tedious in the interest of realism (shouldn't be a bad thing in theory, but for the pruposes of a video game, it can put players to sleep in some missions)
- The initial learning curve is considerable, & the tutorial felt inadequate overall; mechanics are amazing on paper, but take an inordinate amount of time to master

76561197965925721,107410,True,0.955902099609375,"This is not a game for people who want fast action movie style gaming, this is a game for people who appreciate the finer things. Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality. There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release.

One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s.

As we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon. We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols. Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower.

There I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower. I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position. But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed.

As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive.

Falling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command. I had done it. I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive.

That is what this game is about."

Decide to give it another shot but play by its rules and you find that you actually enjoy its complexity. Then somebody comes over and says, you wanna try this but Vietnam and also be in a unit with other dipshits that enjoy this game and you say yes because Vietnam sounds awesome (Spoiler: Its not) and you want to play with a more organized group. 

When you wake up, you have spent 4 years playing with the same group of people, while having 20 FPS on lowest settings and the game is keeping 1 of your week days hostage as you have scheduled events every week. You also subscribe to the Steam forums and check reddit to find more victims to sacrifice to BI so as to have their next patch not fuck up all the 58+ mods you are using 1 hour before your operations...

What Im trying to say is: ARMA is not a game, simulation or the answer to the question: How can I commit a war crimes but not be punished for it. Its the friends we made a long the way to commit those war crimes, every flipped convoy that ruins the operation 15 minutes from starting, its the AI shooting your though 30 layers of foliage, its the enemy artillery firing once but the shell exploding 6  times over a 3km radius, every new guy throwing a grenade under your feet while you play dress up in the arsenal, laughing your ass off as your Zeus tries to spice things up with roll playing, crying as Zeus retaliates for killing his roll play doll for ""lols"", every insane AT shot made by one of your guys, every terribly fired RPG you did, its every time the AI some how flanked you and every time you fight your way though it. 

ARMA is everything and nothing and I cant recommend it enough.

edit: this is a cry for help"
76561198007471493,107410,True,0.94609987735748291,"Where do I start with Arma 3...

 1st of all, have I played enough of this game? No, not in the slightest. My total playtime (see above) is pathetic in comparison to those around me. I see upwards of 2000, 3000, 4000 hours just looking at the reviews currently. At the time of writing this review, I sit on a measly 61 hours of gameplay, so I am in no way an expert of this game. 

 What I CAN  tell you is that there are moments in that 61 hours of gameplay that I will probably never forget. This game makes you feel things you won't feel in any other shooter. Call of Duty thrives on high adrenaline, rapid paced combat. Battlefield slows it down a bit, but maintains a good balance of action and spacing between engagements. 

 Arma 3 is a completely different ballpark. There is a LOT of spacing between engagements, which adds massive suspense and makes every firefight very, very meaningful. When combat initiates, there is definately adrenaline pumping action, but it's not fast. Combat is very slow, almost methodical (just like real life) but very, very... awesome. Some things that you'll see in an Arma firefight that you will not see anywhere else:
 - Engagements will be very long distance, often hundreds of meters away, especially if you're roaming the hills or open wilderness. Enemies may only be a fleck in your scope, on another hill entirely, several football fields away from you.
 - You often won't know where you're getting shot from if you're taken by surprise. You don't get any indicators that say ""Hey! someone to your left just shot you!"". Instead, you'll be forced to take cover and locate the enemy the old fashioned way: watching and listening.
 - If you get shot, you probably wont have time to react. One or two shots will kill you without much warning.
 - Teamplay is CRUCIAL. Medics, Anti-Tank, Heavy Gunners all have a part to play in their teams success. 
 - Communication on a whole other level. There is a radio/audio system in the game that is essential to a squad's success. Squad leaders will be vocal, squadees must be willing to take orders and communicate with their superioirs. Directions will not be called out like ""LEFT! RIGHT!"" but rather with compass bearings such as ""There's at least 3 of them at... 248""
 - Stand/Crouch/Prone is also at another level entirely. You can also hunch over, stand up super tall, sit down, lean on your side, bend your body left and right etc.. Manipulating these stances and using them to show as little of you as possible may be a key factor on whether you live or die
 - Every move you make has a pro and a con attached to it. Fire your weapon? Might kill someone, but you might also give your position away or get shot as you peak out of cover. Forget to look left? Arma teaches that wherever you don't look, there will be something that kills you.
 - NO HITMARKERS. You have to make your own call as to whether or not the guy you just shot is dead. If you make the wrong call, your squad may advance only for one of them to be shot by a (very much alive) enemy solider
 - Tanks and armored vehicles are terrifying. It's not like Battlefield where a tank shows up, everybody continues their daily routines and hopefully somebody with anti tank weaponry deals with the 15 ton chunk of metal. Armored vehicles are terrifyingly powerful with weapons foot soldiers can only dream of. A whole squad of 20 people will immediately hit the deck if one of them shpws up, hoping that their AT guys can do the job because...
  - You don't respawn back into the heat of battle. You reaspawn in a base in the middle of nowhere and you either have to take a helicopter to meet with your squad, or ""HALO jump"", which teleports you to an exaxct location but 6000 feet up in the sky, forcing you to have to use your parachute to land safely. HALO jumping back into combat is suicide. Big shiny glorified baloons make really, really good target practice. That also means...
  - If you lose that aforementioned anti-tank guy, you're hooped unless someone takes the risk and picks the launcher off his dead body. That is, unless the tank/armored car blows him up before he gets there. Then 20 people are stranded with very little to do, which means...
 - Every life counts.

 The combat is unreal. I remember we had to clear this city of enemies, entirely. It took us upwards of an hour, but  we checked every single building, room by room, until, In the center plaza, there he stood; the last man we had to kill. All the other building were checked, and I saw a head poking out behind this obstacle in the dead center of the city,

 ""I found him!"" I yell over the squad's radio, ""Central Garden, straight north"" I notice he pokes his head around the corner. My assault rifle was depleted.

 I knew I should have packed more flipping ammo.
 
 So I pull out my pistol. Fire, miss, fire, miss, rinse andrepeat. I empty my whole clip and the man is not dead. So I reload, and just start Terminator walking my way towards this guy. Firing every round I have. The guy doesn't poke his head out anymore. One clip exhausted, then another. And another. This guy will not die. I least I'm supressing him. 

 Then he pops around, shoots me once. Dead.

 My squad catches up ""What the hell was all that shooting?!"" the commander expresses.
 
 They grenade him. Dead.

 Wish I'd have thought of that sooner. 

 The medic gives me a nice repair. I borrow some mags off of him. We get on the chopper, talking about how wicked that mission was. We get a new one, something about planting a bomb somewhere.

 At this point the squad has bonded. We knew eachothers names, at least. We just kept talking, getting closer to the LZ, mocking the pilot for driving too low to the ground. We land and immediately, the chopper comes under fire.

 ""RUN! SPREAD OUT!""

 The heli blows up before it can leave. We all die in a blaze of glory.

 And I left the game after that.

 I cannot recommend this game enough."
76561198176296555,107410,True,0.944918155670166016,"I spent several years in the army and I gotta say this game is spot on with the training and atmosphere the military provides. I love how difficult this game is, and I love all of the different features the game provides. It is NOT easy to hit a target with an assault rifle from 300 yards in real life, and this game seems to match that same difficulty. Fatigue is a real thing and it seriously hinders your accuracy in real life...Arma 3 makes you stop and catch your breath if you run too far or carry too much gear, or you will have a hard time hitting your target. Enemies are not stupid and they have great vision. I was engaged by two enemies from about 200 yards away and they were using bushes for cover as well as 3-5 second rushes when moving. The AI is more advanced than the average taliban are in real life. haha :p Given my love for the military and for videogames, this one is definitely one of my favorites of all time :D"
76561198130981093,107410,True,0.943312287330627441,"I'm not into arma anymore, but as you can probably tell from the amount of hours I've spent paying this game; I've had an incredible time.

Most of the hours clocked into this game have been spent on roleplay servers. They were so fun back in the day..people weren't too serious, and neither too silly. It was very balanced, very fun. Very replayable.

But arma ain't all about roleplay, so let's talk about other things:

I'll start with combat mechanics, obviously - as the game is all about fighting lol. 
The combat is ABSOLUTELY FLIPPING GREAT! You got things like bullet drop which keeps you on your game, and other things such as weapons becoming less effective as the bullet travels mid-air..you also have very aweosme-looking postures which you can adopt; from laying prone, to sitting on your bum, to crouching, leaning side-to-side, and all dat weird jazz.

It's also very realistic in that, you can only take 1-5 shots before you die pending on which weapon is used against you and what kind of protective gear you have equipped. This means that you have to be VERY careful in-game, otherwise you might just get shot in the head and die. Personally, I enjoy such hardcore mechanics.
Another hardcore mechanic is how damage taken is based on where you are hit on your body. So if you've been shot in the head, you're likely to take a hell of a lot of damage, and this is where armour becomes a huge importance; without armour, you are as vulnerable as a mouse surrounded by a horde of cats. I shouldn't even need to stress how much you need armour! You can go light, or heavy - your choice. The amount you wear does affect movement speed though, so do be careful of that. It also affects how badass you look; I generally like to go light so I look like a badass mofo who is totally capable of destroying anyone who crosses my path lol. Not only that, but your appearance can also affect how easily an enemy can spot you. So if you have a huge bag on your back, and lightly coloured clothes- you can be sure people will spot you with ease.

So yeah. Useful information there, I know. But I am most certainly not done! We have to talk about the tanks, and the awesome vehicles that can totally blow ur balls off!

In arma, there are about 20 different ground vehicles, all unique in both appearance and purpose. You have a few anti-vehicle tanks, a few anti-people tanks, and a few artillery and anti-air tanks. Personally, I love the artillery....they're like mini nukes lol. 

You also have APPACHI ATTACK HELICTOPERS! I mean who doesn't like that!? And some awesome looking submarines and attack planes..and boats :):)
AND CARS WITH MOUNTED TURRETS ON!

Yeah, long-story-short -- arma has tons of vehicles, all awesome in both appearance and nature. Very useful for committing mass-genocide on dem pesky capitalist NATO forces....mmmm, satisfactory

Also sorry for not listing their names. I no good wit dat :(:(

Arma also has lots of game modes to choose from, so you're not restricted to just playing one gamemode and getting bored after an hour. I believe I've already listed one already; roleplay. Others include but are not limited to(due to custom game modes etc); TDM, KOH, KTF, PLAYER VS AI(forgot the official classification, sorry), 5v5 COMPETITIVE MATCHES (like that csgo competitive game mode), custom zombie modes, and survival modes. There are also singleplayer game modes which you can host, such as Zeus or custom Addons which allow for various different gameplay experiences; which brings me to my next topic...

There are loads of mods available on the steam workshop! From halo mods, to Star Wars, to enhanced combat system and mechanic mods, xcom mods, and various others which add more vehicles, factions, armour/clothing, more ai, etc...

The settings menus are also vast and fleshed out in arma, so you can rest assured that you'll be able to configure almost anything you want. 
The game also doesn't require a very high-tier computer to function nominaly, so lag shouldn't really be a problem; especially if you tune down the graphics via the settings menus a bit.

This'll be the last topic within this review; multiplayer.
Multiplayer is obviously a huge part of the game, as I've briefly mentioned previously(with the game modes). This game is almost solely multiplayer-based, but singleplayer is a thing and can be fun, so don't feel restricted. This game being focused mainly on multiplayer is obviously good for playing with friends. You can have much fun playing with friends online in this game, much fun indeed. Lag can be a problem though, so make sure you have a decent internet connection and don't be disappointed if you can't play with a friend based half way across the world from you :) but personally I feel the devs have really improved connectibility over the passed years in terms of multiplayer. Id say it's currently at its peak.

Check this game out. It's relatively cheap for its value, so I advise such.

Apologies if I've missed some flavourful features or mechanics. I'll definitely be sure to edit this review if anyone comes in screaming at me about how I didn't include ""this and that and this and that and this and that"" lol.

We're on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back. I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing.

I run, my Autorifleman runs, my Medic runs. But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across.

Anybody seen Full Metal Jacket all the way through? Remember the sniper scene?

The marksman takes a round in the leg as we're running and goes down. He then takes two more in the chest. The kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here.

     Now that I am at almost 730 hours played at the time of this review's initial publication I thought it was time for me to review my favorite game. This is not going to be a typical review where they say something along the lines of ""swam in the air, 79 out of 10 would be break laws of physics again,"" although that has happened to me and it was hilarious. This is going to be an in depth and honest review of Arma 3.

First though, here is some context.

      When Arma 3 first came out in 2013 I was so excited because I had been watching Arma 2 for so long and I was really hyped on the Arma 3 trailers, not that I actually had a good enough computer to play either one of them of course, so I waited until I finally did. I waited for 3 1/2 years watching YouTube videos and wishing that I could have Arma 3, It was sheer torment. All the cool things that people did just made the situation worse: every valiant last stand against zombies that saved the city, every stealth mission that crippled the enemy, and every close air support gun run that saved a convoy that was under threat just made me want Arma 3 more. So, when I finally had a computer that was good enough to play games on it one of the first games that I got was Arma 3.

       Arma 3 was nothing like I had expected it to be, it was better. An entire virtual sandbox for me to do anything I wanted, go anywhere I wanted, and play any way I wanted. It was not like a ""sophisticated Battlefield"" or a ""Call of Duty on steroids"" like I was expecting it to be, or how I was told it was. Arma 3 is just better. Those descriptions don't even remotely do the game justice. The modding support is astounding to say the least, like I said earlier, zombies. The maps are gorgeous, the weapons are wonderfully modeled, and you have a fully customizable character from the face, to the clothes, to the voice. Arma 3 is more than meets the eye, sure it‚Äôs beautiful, but it also has a great deal of depth behind that gorgeous high polygon count tree, and highly reflective water, and I love it to death for it.

       Arma 3 is in some ways the next logical step for somebody who is into the first person shooter genre, you probably don't know what they say about the game but here it is anyway. ""Children play Call of Duty, boys play Battlefield, men play Arma."" I feel like this statement is true, at least on some levels. The Arma series just feels mature to me, and much more refined than Call of Duty or Battlefield as well. They are not games where you can easily be a""Super Duper MACV Recon SOG SEAL Delta Force Green Beret CIA Operator,"" go ""gunz blazin,"" and kill ""all dem dudes over dere."" Although that sometimes works much to my own surprise and amusement. Arma 3 requires at least some modicum of strategy, or my personal favorite, a great big helping of luck to win, or even be good at in some cases, and I think that is good thing, Arma demands that people invest time into.

       Arma 3 has a large amount of multiplayer content that somebody can enjoy, you can play on a life server and rise through the ranks to become whoever you want to be, whether you want to be are a brutal crime lord, or the mayor of the town. The king of the hill servers bring a nice challenge to Arma 3 where you can fight in and against, in a perfect world, a well organized group of players who are trying very diligently to accomplish their objectives in Arma 3's virtual world. I loved Arma so much that I decided to found a unit which can be found here: join.crabsunion.com

The choice really is up to you on what you want to do in the game, and the built in mission maker with the option to add a ""Zeus"" for mission changes on the fly is always a great option. It is fun to play God for a while, and terrorize your friends.

       The singleplayer content of Arma 3 is quite good, I am very much enjoying the new ""Stepping Stone"" campaign, where NATO forces are trying to seize the picturesque island of Malden in an attempt to attain and maintain aerial dominance over the critically important Strait of Gibraltar.The ""Apex Protocol Campaign"" is very well made in my opinion with several missions that make you feel like you really are a ""Super Duper MACV Recon SOG SEAL Delta Force Green Beret CIA Operator."" Another great thing about the Apex Protocol campaign is that it gives you the option of playing it with friends if you so choose, something I wish the other campaigns did as well.

       Many people say that Arma 3 has a steep learning curve and I disagree. You pick up new things very quickly in Arma 3, or at least I do. Arma 3 just has so much to learn that many people think that it is a very difficult game to play when it is not. Almost every time I play Arma 3 I learn something new about the game or how to play it more effectively. It does not matter whether this is some knowledge about how to use Zeus or make mission more effectively, if it is some new tactic for clearing houses, or even if it is a technique on how to get more stable frame rate. Even with my amount of play time, and the amount of videos I have watched on Arma 3, I am still learning new things constantly. I believe that fact alone sets Arma 3 apart from other games.

       Arma 3 is a somewhat underappreciated treasure in the gaming world with endless content and unlimited scenarios to explore and it deserves more publicity than it is getting. I hope that this review was helpful to you and informative as well. Furthermore I hope that it didn‚Äôt bore you to death too much. Anyways, you have a great day now."

Great game for the more serious war gamer, not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from Call of Duty series which I consider more for the younger gamers anyway.

Arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games, similar to Battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using. You will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10-20 minutes in a single location (sometimes longer, I personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward.

You will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance.

You can not respawn as quickly as you can in CoD if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic.

The graphics are great, the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to.

I recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible (unless doing paintballing or airgunning), and if you do buy the game - I recommend completing the whole VR Tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the Campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game."

August 20th 2019. I was in a Squad of 7 men. I had the duty of a combat life saver. We had to fly oversea's on a Helicopter. I couldn't tell if my pilot was drunk or my dial up internet was making the helicopter do acrobatics but it was intense. About 5 minutes of flying we touch down safely, getting out as my ears immediately explode from my sound mod making the helicopter 5000x louder. It was awesome. We continue down the road for another 200m when a sniper from the treeline blows off one of my boys heads. We all scramble for cover behind the hill. My boy and I had to kill the MMG who were suppressing our men. We take a flank to the left in hopes of gunning this asshole down. Because the AI are fucking superman, me and my boy were immediately spotted and suppressed by sniper fire behind a rock. He gets hit in the chest which caused a velocity wound and other medical wounds. I sew him up like the god I am and we continue down the hill under all sorts of fire. I take a bullet to my arm and leg, making me as slow as a 60 year old asthmatic hippo with 3 legs. I stitch up my wounds and began limping to some more cover. I fix my leg somehow and im mobile again, pushing into the objective we were supposed to take an hour ago. Our NATO squad successfully raided the base. Only 2 men were killed and all CSAT have been eliminated.

Or so we thought.

The man on the radio sounds like his balls dropped off Mount Everest. He tells us CSAT reinforcements will be arriving shortly. I was unprepared with only 3 mags of ammunition and only a few medical bandages and morphine left. After a few minutes of respite, a shot is echoed from the hills and another firefight takes place again. These assholes now have armored cars with .50 guns on them. 4 of our men are killed within seconds. Thankfully i brought AT rockets with me and I take out the armored car. It explodes in a fiery mess, leaving that area scorched. My boy and I take cover behind a shitty jeep as more and more bullets fly over our heads. He gets hit in the chest 2 times and in the leg 3. I'm out of ammunition in both weapons and I am forced to drag him behind a tree. I take a hit to my chest and start to bleed out. Medical supplies are running thin. 

A few minutes passed and the CSAT have stopped firing. They probably thought we all died. I failed to medic my friend as his cold, dead body lay in the grass. I scavenge off my dead teammates for ammo, leaving my aim in the garbage due to the multiple wounds to the arms. Just when I thought all was over, a NATO chopper has came to evacuate me. I have a blood pressure of the exact definition of trash, my heart rate is 50 and my screen is black and white. I'm limping up a hill while taking multiple shots from the CSAT hiding in the thick brush. I am able to get into the chopper and escape as the last man in my squad to live. 

From that day on, I have diagnosed myself with PTSD. Only play if your balls are made of titanium."

76561198123083438,107410,True,0.926028549671173096,"For this review I'm going to open with a price breakdown, because at the end of the day when you're looking at getting a game you're trying to figure out whether or not it's worth it.

[h1]Price Breakdown[/h1]
Full price of the game and all DLC without deals or bundles $200.25

With my 4,000 hours of gameplay that equates to
 $0.0502375 an hour of playtime (Or about 5 cents)
 $1.2057 a day of playtime

Days between 1 August 2016 (When I bought it) and 12 March 2020 (date of this review)
That's 1,319 days or 31,656 hours
 $0.00632581501137225170583775587566‚Ä¨ an hour (or about half a cent)
 $0.15181956027293404094010614101592 a day (Or about 15 cents)


Arma is a near future military sandbox experience that gives players access to play how they want, whether they want to be infantry, tank operators, war journalists, helicopter pilots, jet pilots, boat captains, divers. Arma has something to suit any players wants.

[h1]Are the DLCs worth it?[/h1]
So when we're looking at value it is well worth it. I often run into people going on in lobbies about how Arma is always bringing out DLCs that cost way too much for what they are and that Bohemia is just a moneyhungering company, but when you break it down the level of detail they bring to the table and the time you spend on the content is unparalleled in terms of replayability. Aside from the singleplayer campaigns and the maps introduced in DLCs all of the content is actually free to use whether you own the DLC or not, the only downside is that if you do use something that you don't own the DLC for then a watermark will show up on the side of your screen for a few seconds every five to ten minutes or so.

It seems that in many peoples eyes the most cardinal sins are the Contact DLC and Laws of War DLC. But I only ever hear complaints about them from people that when I get into debates with them they say 'Oh, I forgot Arma had a singleplayer."" or ""Pfffft, no one plays the singleplayer."" But this last statement couldn't be more wrong. In fact in terms of parts of this game that shine, the singleplayer campaigns and missions are a big part of that.

[h1]Singleplayer[/h1]
The way the tutorial seemlessly blends into the story of the larger campaign, to the political turmoil you find yourself being embroiled in, to the intrigue of the moral dilemmas you find yourself asking at the end of the Laws of War campaign. These stories are memorable! If you ever dip your hands in the Zeus gamemode (the veritable Dungeons and Dragons of the Armaverse) you'll often find yourself recreating some of those memorable experiences for other players, such as the uneasy downtime and that suspenseful few moments before a major gunfight.

[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]
If singleplayer isn't your thing then the multiplayer will keep you coming back again and again, whether you want to have a PVP killfest in King of the Hill, a PVE mission based gamemode in Invade and Annex or Antistasi, the aforementioned Zeus gamemode, a roleplay experience in ArmaLife servers, or a hardcore military simulation. Arma has it all. When it comes to the multiplayer, most of my most enjoyable moments have been the downtime in between missions, whether chilling at the base or traveling to the area of operations. Arma multiplayer is a social experience at heart and that's where the multiplayer experience really shines in my eyes. I have met many people over the years that I am still good friends with to this day, and I have Arma to thank for that. We have had good times together and even better stories to tell. When I was first playing this game I didn't have a microphone so I had to type everything I wanted to get across, because of that I inadvertently learnt touch typing, which is pretty strange to say when someone asks you how you learnt to touch type. The official servers can become quite chaotic, but if you find a nice server a community is hosting then that can be like a second home, even with some of the chaotic people in the official servers the community as a whole is the most welcoming community I've come across in a game.

[h1]Community[/h1]
Touching on the community, Arma has a strong and committed modding and content creation community, mainly due to the passion of the users and the easy to use modding and mission creation tools, such as the 3DEN editor, a 3d mission maker contained within the game itself which harkens back to the golden age of Real Time Strategy games, such as Age of Empires. So if what you want to do isn't quite in the game, you're sure to find a mod or a mission that allows you to do that and if you can't there is an abundance of information on how to make it yourself. And with the easeability of sharing modlists, it's easy to bundle all of the mods you need to make the experience you want to play and then share the list with your mates so that you can all play together.

[h1]Is Arma The Game For You?[/h1]
All in all there is a lot of downtime in this game, so if you're all about instant gratification, killstreaks and being the best of the best then this game probably isn't for you. Arma is a team game and a lot of the game is spent walking, travelling or planning which gives you a lot of time to get to know your team. So if you're not into that then this might not be the game for you when it comes to the multiplayer. If you're looking for a game that is a million different games however, Arma is for you. Because every experience is different and with mods it can even be an entirely different game, for an example just look at DayZ or PlayersUnknownBattlegrounds which both started their lives as mods on Arma.

Arma 3, best 4,000 I've spent in a game ever."
76561198097852352,107410,True,0.925913095474243164,"After putting in over 3500 hours, I have seen the good, the bad, and the downright ugly that ARMA III has to offer. With that being said, I offer my review. It will be a bit long, but after this much time in game, there is a lot to discuss. 

First off, the campaign for single player is ok, but not great. You will be able to find other games with better campaign story modes than ARMA III as the main focus is put on the Multiplayer aspect. However, the campaign and story does prove challenging and the story is solid enough to keep you entertained and engaged. 

Secondly, The DLC content is hit or miss. 

GOOD DLC!
-Tanks add several new tanks into the game and make putting a AP round through your enemy a joy!
-Jets add several new jets to wreak havoc with! It also adds a aircraft carrier!
-Marksman adds some of the best sniper rifles in the game period! Also adds several ghillie suits and scopes. 

Decent DLC.
-Helicopters adds two helis to the game. Mostly for heavy lifting. 
-APEX adds an Island called Tanoa. A dozen weapons and gear. A few vehicles and a few VTOL aircraft. 

Bad DLC!
-Karts. Go-karts on a battlefield. Is this a joke?
-Laws of War. A single player mini campaign for a multiplayer focused game.  Not worth your money.
- Tac-Ops. Again, another single player mini campaign in a multiplayer focused game. Not worth your money.

Third on the list in multiplayer. The true fun to be had with ARMA III is through the multiplayer. There are 1000's of servers all with different options to chose from fitting nearly every type and style of game play. Zombies, they got it. Not into Zombies? No problem. Co-op, yep! Role play, check! Survival, you bet! PvP for those that like to kill others and PvE for the more casual crowd can be found.

Fourth. The community of players found in ARMA III are some of the best I have seen. They are often found to be helpful and willing to lend a hand to newer players and also to veterans in need of assistance. With that being said, you will however run into the occasional troublemaker, rule breaker, or very rarely a hacker. Most of them are dealt with swiftly by the server admins. Then, also,  there is those few players who have little time to read the server rules and blindly run off into the battlefield annoying players by doing things they shouldn't. When corrected by others, they will usually reply "" I didn't know the rules. "" A word of advice. When entering a server, read the rules or simply ask in chat and other players will usually be happy to explain them. 

Fifth, the graphics. For a game that is over 5 years old, the graphics are good. Not great mind you, but good to say the least. 

Sixth, the game play. ARMA III focuses on two things. Realistic militarised game play and multiplayer action via servers. Most of the servers run mods created by people like you and me. Some are about survival and will have you scrounging the map for supplies and gear. Some are about playing team death-match. Some are co-op missions. They can be very fun and can add a lot of vehicles, maps, gear, aircraft, weapons, scenarios, and more to the game. However, no one is prefect and you will find yourself dead periodically after simply opening a door, walking down stairs, entering a vehicle, exiting a vehicle, etc. The point is, expect the unexpected. While this does not happen all the time, you most definitely will encounter a few bugs and glitches from time to time. The most common and frustrating is the sudden vanishing of vehicles left at your base. ARMA loves to eat vehicles for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Also, it will eat your gear, weapons, base, and well....pretty much anything.  So don't get too attached to your stuff. As a server admin for several different servers, I have spent entire days replacing lost items. However, do not expect all admins to be as accommodating as losing items in ARMA is all part of the game.

In all, ARMA III can be a very fun game to play. It's strength comes from the almost limitless ways the game can be played on the 1000's of available servers. After all this time, I still find myself spending the weekends running missions on several servers. In the end, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes realistic military style games."

311 days ago i was Developer banned from Arma 3. The day before i received this ban i had decided to download arma after months away from it. I downloaded the game, it remembered all my mods, downloaded them then i fired the game up.

Do you lads feel out of sorts some times and you sit looking at you vast steam library wondering what to play. Its kinda like choosing a film on Netflix, before you know it times up and you cant be bothered. It was like that. I sat in the in game menu for one minute (screen shot to prove it) before deciding not to play. I exited the game, steam and shut down my PC. 

The following day i decided i was going to fully get back into it. I loaded up my computer. Steam automatically opened but this time with a message. You have been banned from the following games (ARMA 3).

It stated i was banned by the developer. I immediately thought why the hell was i banned. I contacted BI within ten minutes. The response was the same as it remains today. 'we do not deal with bans, battleye do. Please contact battleye if you need support with a ban.' 

BUT YOU DO DEAL WITH BANS - THIS IS A DEV BAN NOT A BE BAN????

I spent the last 10 months contacting BE who eventually responded to tell me that they did not ban me nor did they find anything on my PC that was suspicious to them at the time of my ban. They informed my my logs were 'spotless'

I swung my attention back around to BI. I contacted them the other day. A chap called Dominik responded saying the ban was a battleye ban not a DEV ban.  I have since sent him images of my ban stating it was a DEV ban, steams explanation of a DEV BAN which states a developer informs valve of an account that is suspicious and valve ban them. I have sent images of my conversation with BE and proof that in the two weeks before my ban i had one minute of game time which was spent in the menu. 

The emails have fallen of deaf ears.....No response from Dominik. 

I am absolutely heart broken that from the past 10 months i have been unable to play with my friends and it looks like this situation is not going to change. I am disgusted as the lack of acknowledgement and willingness to support and resolve this from BI. 

I have so many fond memories in Arma 2, OH & 3 but it looks like this is the end of the road for me. I will miss the random chats in game, the communities i was part of and the battles of the field.

76561198061912275,107410,True,0.910561800003051758,"Arma 3 is like that long-term girlfriend/boyfriend you date where, at the honeymoon phase, you are smitten and are like ""wow, this is a 10/10 unique experience."" However, as the months turn to years and time rolls on, you start to realize there are shinier, prettier experiences out there- better looks, sexier moves, more stable, but you stick with it. You realize you're really with a solid 7/10, but **** is it fun. There are things he/she can do that no one else can, and well, despite deviations time to time to fantasize about other experiences, and several on-again/off-again times spent dabbling in those fantasies, you find yourself coming back to him/her. You find yourself truly happy...even after the worst (and unstable) times. Come to think of it, maybe this isn't a healthy relationship, but at the end of the day, it's a **** fun one.

Arma is an unstable, buggy ride and a bit overwhelming on first impressions, but it's an experience that you don't get in any other sandbox game or military shooter. The community is really what drives this game. It's a quasi-sim/quasi-arcade experience that can be tailored to the community/user's need given a little time spent learning how it all works. The developers do a decent job of providing documentation to understand how content creation and mission editing functions, and the community fills (and exceeds) the areas unfulfilled and self-imagined. There are few communities as diverse and robust as Arma's. In one night's events, you can go from playing a modern-day military sim night with your homies, to WWII, Vietnam, then Star Wars, Halo, Starship Troopers, Aliens, to the bloody revolutionary war and more. In short, Arma should be judged more as a sandbox & framework for community addons than a game on its own, and one that over the last 6 years developed into being highly accessible to the average user without even needing to touch a text editor or understand how it works to get custom games going through its implementation of a ""Dungeon Master"" style mission builder called ""Zeus."" Arma's experience varies greatly depending on your level of tolerance for troubleshooting and patience with searching/installing addons. 

This is best experienced by being dragged in by a community of friends... really it's kind of Stockholm Syndrome that kept me in it to start, and the incredible, fun, sometimes frustrating, and hilarious experiences made along the way is something no other game has offered and keeps me coming back. Give it a go, or watch some communities stream their experiences and see for yourself."

76561197979139992,107410,True,0.908434510231018066,"Well after playing this game for a few hours I thought it was about time to write a review.

I struggle to think of many games past or present that manage to do what Arma 3 does. Before the impending praise I'm about to give this game I will say 2 things. 

First, there will be bugs. Not the Starship Troopers kind... Well actually you can kill bugs as a Starship Trooper but I'm talking glitches, rubber banding, inventory issues, layer upon layer of mods causing compatibility issues and the list goes on. You simply have to embrace these problems and make them part of the enemy which you have to overcome! If you are easily put off by the above, Arma isnt for you, in fact the way games are pushed out these days a don't think many games would be for you.

Second, so far I have spent ¬£150 on this game (not including money spent on my own private server endeavours and donations to other public server communities) which sounds and is slightly ridiculous HOWEVER I have spent over 6000 hours on this game which is more than the rest of my steam library combined so as a time spent versus money paid its the cheapest game I've ever bought. All I say to anyone who somehow doesn't own it yet is wait for a Steam super sale and buy everything in one nice discount and your laughing!

The above remain the only 2 reasons I would not recommend this game, price Inc all dlc and the constant battle with bugs etc. All that aside Arma 3 is simply one of the best things you can buy for your PC. From the seemingly infinite Steam Workshop content to the fact that you can do anything from Milsim team based combat to simple PvP to cooperative missions to RPG style game modes to racing mods and a small off shoot you may have heard of called DayZ (Arma 2 mod but ya know what I'm getting at) it really does tick every box. There is a huge learning curve in the form of keybindings. It takes time just finding the right section to rebind keys but once you are comfortable I find the control of your character, chopper, jet, quad bike, humvee, tank, golf caddy etc quite intuitive. No other game gives you as many stances to be in. You can literally find a stance which gives you line of sight through a small hole in a wall at any angle. There are basic and advanced settings for flying so you can feel like a pro or take it easy with simplified physics and controls.

One final word... Community! As with all games you are bound to find trolls and people too competitive to remember what manners are, however on the whole Arma has a great community of players. I play 90% coop missions these days and it is just a breath of fresh air to be playing multiplayer on such a grand scale without this furious and frantic atmosphere which is so prominent in most multilayer games these days. After the demise of the Battlefield franchise after BC2 and BF3 I really needed a game to fill my need for military shooters and Arma 3 came to my rescue.

Rather than go on and on, all I will end on saying is that this game is more like a template for you to then decide what you actually want to spend your time doing. If you are on the fence, browse the workshop and see the sheer amount of 5 star community made content from overhaul mods to subtle quality of life mods. You could spend 6000 hours just playing all the single player campaigns made by other users."

One day, not so long ago, my squad had just destroyed an anti-air battery. Our pilot landed, and the rest of the squad boarded one by one. I was about to get in when the rockets started flying.

The chopper lifted off, with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes. Unwilling to die before then, I rushed to the nearest cover, a small house by a narrow road. I entered to find a ten year-old player who had also been left behind. He explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his ""clan"".

I politely declined, explaining that my own squad was inbound. As I finished, a Ghost Hawk flew over the horizon. My squad had arrived.

This noble child soldier and I were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting. The sniper screamed as a 6.5 mm cartridge entered his leg. His shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as I climbed in the transport.

Grossly outdated graphics engine, poorly optimised, it remains the closest game you can ever play to the real thing. During its heyday, milsim communities and modders made this more of an experience than some simple combat simulator - I was able to don exactly the same equipment, uniform and loadouts that I served with while in the army.
NOT worth it if you're playing vanilla arma - terrifying and immersive if you use mods.
You can eat, climb walls, abseil, drink, splint fractures, dress burns, dig foxholes, engage in melee, interrogate, be suppressed and find yourself in a house being breached and cleared by the enemy.
Unless it's vanilla...
Mods are everything."

76561197971414496,107410,True,0.896043360233306885,"Arma 3 is a tricky game to review, but here‚Äôs me trying it anyway.

The reason why this game is so hard to review lies in the sheer size of the game and the variety of things it may or may not offer for the player.

I take Arma 3 for what it is first and foremost: a platform. What you get is a good looking game with a solid (would be great, but you have to do some optimization to boost your performance) engine, two amazing maps (Stratis and Altis, which is probably the most impressive map I‚Äôve seen in any open world-ish game) and the prospect of near endless new content from the community.

What you don‚Äôt get is an easy to get into mil-shooter with CoD sized maps and a quick pace. If you‚Äôre in for uncomplicated, fast paced PvP gameplay, you should probably look elsewhere. If you‚Äôre sick of that, however, Arma 3 might be just your thing. 

The strength of the Arma series is freedom (**** yeah). You are free to mod the game into almost anything you want, create any type of mission and make your very own gameplay experience. You have to invest some time into the game, but once you got into it, the opportunities are endless.

Want to play huge adversial or coop maps with a hundred players or more?  Arma is just your thing and there are big communities (in many different languages) that will help you find that epic experience.

Want to play singe player? Well, if you expect strong single player content with interesting characters and storyline and so on, then Arma 3 isn‚Äôt the game you‚Äôre looking for.  Or is it? Right now Bohemia delivered one part of a three part campaign ‚Äì those missions are challenging, offer a solid variety of infantry gameplay but don‚Äôt expect a good story or interesting characters. But as mentioned before ‚Äì the huge amount of community made missions and mods offer hours and hours of playtime.

Personally I prefer small cooperative missions to play with friends. Already the steam workshop has countless missions for 2-5 players. 

So, should you buy Arma 3? Well, I‚Äôd certainly recommend it, if any of the things I mentioned above sounds fun to you. It is to say though, that this game is not something that everyone might like, so stay away from it if you are not willing to invest some time into it.

I hope that this review helped some people to decide whether or not they should by Arma 3. Please note that I‚Äôm not a native English speaker, so the language used in this review might seem a little odd for some."

Briefly, I remember that every single second I've played this game is my favorite memory. As I do so, the developer's splash screen flashes on the screen, followed by the warm  welcome of the ARMA III logo and subsequent main menu screen. In this moment, I feel happy and fulfilled. The events of the real world bear no importance to me as I undertake the task of deciding what I'm going to get myself into today. Shall it be Altis life antics? Do I recreate the Osama Bin Laden raid with my friends? Should I attempt to put myself into the shoes of a Marine in the middle of the Tet Offensive of late 1968? My mind wanders into the child-like curiosity and the uncertainty of the events that will take place tonight, and therefore I am excited. This is my conscious mind. My subconscious, however, is aware of one simple, true fact. I am free."

[b] Welcome to Arma 3: The Big One [/b]

If you didn't just start PC gaming an hour ago, you've probably heard of Arma 3. Every time someone says the names Call of Duty, Battlefield, Squad, Red Orchestra, Verdun, or any other shooter title out there, they do so in hushed tones and with their hands over their mouths for fear of the inevitable tongue-lashing they're about to receive from an Arma fan.
Fans of the Arma series are fiercly loyal and totally uncompromising. I have little doubt you've heard the following phrases:

[list]
[*]""If you want [i] realism, [/i] you should play Arma.""
[*]""Only casuals play. . . .""
[*]""Arma 3 is way better because . . . .  and  . . . . ""
[/list]

It's annoying and inarguably elitist but, in their defense, also mostly true. Arma 3 is not for someone who is looking for a casual shooter experience. Arma 3 is for those of us that want to camp out in the trees, waiting for the three guys you saw 30 minutes before, and hoping you can pull of a successful ambush quickly, quietly, and without getting hit. Then, walking for another 30 minutes to link up with another squad, grab some vehicles, and truck a few kilometers out to set up a new FOB. You can expect to go upwards of 3 hours without firing a shot on certain servers.

Which brings me to my next point. . . 

[b] The Game Within a Game Within a Game Within a Game. . . . [/b]

One of A3's major selling points is it's massive, active, dedicated, and diverse community of modders. Arma 3 has a great single player campaign and a few nice King of the Hill and Wasteland servers that you will want to visit occasionally, but Arma gets particularly interesting when you go mod shopping. 

in the mood to lose track of 30 hours while you're dodging police officers and rival gangs as you fight to expand your criminal empire across Altis and/or Tanoa?
Asylum 'Life' servers are a personal favorite of mine. Complete with a living, player-driven economy, impactful politics between gangs and a police force trying to keep control of the island as these gangs throw lead and shade at one another in a constant struggle for turf. If that sounds familiar to you, make no mistake, GTA V doesn't come close to touching the complexity of Life servers.

There are mods for different eras of warfare, gamemodes for about anything you can imagine, and you can find most of them on Steam Workshop, making it easy to access and giving you infinite playtime. You literally cannot run out of things to do because there is [i] always [/i] more content.

I could honestly write about Arma all evening but I'll leave you with a few pros and cons and then I'll wrap things up for you.

[b] PROS: [/b]
[list]
[*]Infinite play value, you can never run out of content
[*]satisfying and memorable moments come to those with patience
[*]game modes for almost everything thanks to the modding community
[*]great graphics for excellent immersion
[*]Endless selection of weapons, vehicles, gear, etc.
[*]Shed your 'casual' title and pick up the mark of 'master' gamer
[/list]

[b] CONS: [/b]
[list]
[*]Arma 3 is not well optimized and is very CPU intensive. Still perfectly playable at 30fps though you will need a high end i7 if you expect to get anywhere near 60fps on most multiplayer servers. AMD users be warned.
[*]Seriously not for casual gamers. I cannot stress this enough. It can take hours to accomplish simple goals depending on your game mode. Highly satisfying when things come together, though.
[*]Expect to move slowly while learning controls. Arma 3 is a game that uses just about [i] all [/i] of your keyboard and it will take you a while to master.

[b] But Should I Buy It? [/b]

I can't recommend this game enough. But if you're a die-hard Call of Duty fan but you still pick up this title, you're in for a rude awakening. Casual gamers be warned."
76561198072447858,107410,True,0.889115750789642334,"What did you do today? I did walk into a stopsign and died in Arma 3.
Meh.. After 3099 hours and 15000 deaths later it's still a game you will return back to.
Thumbsup all the way."
76561198026803446,107410,True,0.888425886631011963,Just buy it. Look at how many hours I have in this game. It's the best money you'll ever spend. It is all things to all gamers.
76561197995591955,107410,True,0.88792949914932251,"Can't tell you if you should buy it or not, but I can tell you this.
You will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isn't there and lack of content if you're not satisfied with what you have. 
But when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, it's something magical you just can't find in any other game.

Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly.
Arma is a game which you can never called finished. There will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations. 

Hope I expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :)

If you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem!

I'll give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, I've used hundreds of hours on Arma 3 that I would never take back.

""ARE YOU F*CKING SERIOUS?! THIS IS MEANT TO BE A MILSIM SERVER AND YOU HAVEN'T EVEN ALTERED YOUR F*CKING RADIO""

Now, some people don't care much for the realism, and prefer action-movie esque shooters. That's fine. However, this game shines at gritty realistic firefights. There's nothing glorious about shouting contact reports into the radio, bounding cover to cover, and hoping the next round doesn't have your name on it, but when you're finally back on the bird with your buddies headed home, and you finally feel the sense of relief wash over you.

76561198049422365,107410,True,0.882125139236450195,"Being an avid ArmA 2 Wasteland/DayZ player back in the day (about 1.5 years ago), I relished the thought of a new ArmA coming out. ArmA 2 was practically uknown until it's popularity was increased by DayZ. I found it interesting to jump into a BI (Bohemia Interactive) title that already had a steady fan-base behind it. Having been about a year since I purchased this game (launch) and over 100 hours of solid gameplay I feel that I can finally write a review that encompasses many of the aspects I have experienced within this game. Now I know what you're thinking: ""$59.99?! This isn't even considered a triple A title! That's like... that's like the price of CoD: Ghosts!"" Now, don't be intimidated by this price, for I can say that off the bat this game is worth a lot more than $59.99. From a value perspective, I found the price to be very reasonable based on the game's content nowadays.

Basically, ArmA is a series of hardcore military simulation; constantly reflecting real-world conditions into a video game. In ArmA 2, I feel that this was it's drawback, for there were certain scenarios where it was realistic to a point of frustration (breaking your leg on a 2 foot fall. It's a game guys, relax). ArmA 3 has found a good balance between an FPS/3rd Person shooter game and realism, making it extremely enjoyable as both a simulator [i] and [/i] a game. I also found that ArmA 3 has very good support for newbies to the series and is able to really engage players into the fun. I imagine it is much easier to get into ArmA 3 than I did ArmA 2 (I can't judge, I'm not new to it). 

The engine is decently optimized and is far less clunkier than the ArmA 2 engine, however rocks are still (and I guess forever will be) broken. Perhaps the game is having difficulty conforming such free player movement with an un-even surface. 

Pro tip: NEVER WALK ON ROCKS UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.

The game also has a variety of content; although players coming over from 2 will notice that there are A LOT less guns. This is partly due to the customization of guns. Instead of having a separate gun for each gun variation (M4A1 HOLO, M4A1 CCO, M4A1) you have a base gun and you are able to add sights, lasers, silencers, flashlights, what have you. However, this is not a full excuse- I feel that there are still a lesser amount of overall GUNS to shoot. Perhaps Bohemia Interactive is trying to fine-tune each gun into the patches as opposed to adding a ton of mediocre weapons simply for variety's sake. What's also very surprisingly good in this game is the Nvidia PhysX that was incorporated. Seeing my transport truck's wheels constantly bumping up and down according to the land under me while I drive troops through the night is oh-so-satisfying as well as, well... realistic! The physics engine has been extremely improved and I quite like it.

I'd like to finally talk about how the guns shoot and how they sound, for this is after all, a big part of the game. Once again I will compare it to ArmA 2, in saying clearly that ArmA 2 featured a more high-pitched ""tappy"" sound when you shot with vertical recoil, while 3 brings a much more deeper, louder shot as well as echo to accompany it as the gun travels backwards into your viewmodel as opposed to upwards. The guns definitely feel better for me, but in the end I'd like to classify this judgment as personal preference.

Lastly, the gamemodes of ArmA 3 are diverse and excellent, my favourite being Wasteland script. I won't go into detail here. There is also King of Hill, DayZ (OF COURSE, but it's MEH) and of course standard operations. Altis Life is also a really sweet one! Check those out if you end up buying.

So yeah, I really like this game and I think that there is so much potential for a growing community. Grab some buddies, hop into Stratis and keep overwatch with some snipers and riflers as you and your team move in through the bushes to grab an objective for more supplies for your squad! Really great game, I'd definitely recommend to any FPS/MILSIM fan! :D"

76561197963644421,107410,True,0.881744086742401123,"If you're coming to Arma 3 as an Arma series veteran, you already know what to expect. For the most part, the game hasn't changed since the last installment, but then it's always felt a little bit like Bohemia Interactive are still building on the groundwork laid back in 2001 by Operation Flashpoint, in the world's longest ever game of 'development Buckaroo'. Thankfully, the whole thing has yet to fall to pieces in any significant manner; it's quite happy to continue wobbling uneasily for now.

Arma has a reputation. It's known to be frighteningly obtuse, bewilderingly complex, and often hilariously broken. I can tell you right now that Arma 3 is no different, and absolutely still deserves that reputation. Thankfully, I don't think it's unfair to say that this is the closest an Arma game has come to being 'user friendly'. The controls have been tweaked, and the interface refined a little to accommodate more modern tastes. For these improvements alone, I do recommend it to newcomers to the series over any previous entry.
Coming from any other modern FPS game, it will still take a good few hours of what can feel an awful lot like hard work to get to grips with the controls, but I honestly think Arma 3 will see a far lower 'drop-out rate' of newbies who were frustrated to the point of giving up by the previous games.

At the time of writing, the elephant in the room is the lack of content available. When compared to Arma 2 (which is handsomely bolstered by an array of official expansion packs), the amount of hardware available to play with is frustratingly slim. In many cases, opposing armies are equipped with identical vehicles which get a slightly different paint job at best. For anyone used to the myriad of variants and oddments available in Arma 2, Arma 3 can feel awfully disappointing.
Fortunately, this is alleviated to some extent by the strong mod community. It has long been the case that the best parts of the Arma games are the parts not developed by Bohemia Interactive themselves, and Arma 3 is most definitely continuing this 'tradition'. Nevertheless, I can't help but feel that the game could've done with a few months more time in the oven before full public release.

Speaking of the mod community, I think it's criminal that almost none of the best, near-indispensible mods from Arma 2 have been officially integrated. For a self-professed 'war simulator', Arma 3 is hugely lacking in basic features like being able to rest your weapon on surfaces (even with a visible bipod), or tow damaged vehicles.

For all its flaws, though, Arma 3 is still a blast to play. If you can find a decent group of like-minded gamers with access to a voice-over-net server, you're in for some of the best gaming you'll ever experience. Sure, you'll probably have to load up on mods to satisfy your need for variety. And sure, sometimes the game will crash spectacularly, or the physics engine will flip out and kill you for standing too close to a wall. But when you're standing on a hilltop, looking out over an enemy outpost with your squadmates while a CAS helicopter strafes an enemy APC and spots targets for a distant sniper team; when everything clicks together in the way that only Arma can manage, you'll be glad to have been along for the ride."

76561198019977288,107410,True,0.875654399394989014,"I don't know where to start with this but let's just try:

My first experience with ArmA was with the Operation Flashpoint Series and later on with ArmA 1 (Cold war Assault) and then ArmA 2 (+ all possible Add-Ons).
And i just have to say, that i freakin fell in love with this game (ArmA3) from the very begining.

Sure there were heaves of problems, bugs and shit going wrong at the beginning but i still bought this game as soon as it was availabe (Which should've been like early Alpha or so).

But to explain why i sank over propably 2000 hours of my life into this game:

-Versatility: With the workshop added and all the mod support the game offers, it's just incredible for how long you are able to find new stuff. New Maps, weapons, uniforms, AI-Units, vehicles, helicopers, tanks, etc. etc.

-Versitility: With the ZEUS Modul and the Ed3n Editor you are able to creato soooooo much stuff. You can create YOUR OWN scenarios, and the overview them and change them while playing with zeus. if you play with a few people and you keep changing the missio maker you never ever ever run out of ideas/scenarios to play.

-Versitilititititiy: I think we've bee here before... With the huge mod support theres other beefits aswell. If you are playing onlie you will be able to find all sorts of server. wether you like playing as a lone wolf and kill other players, play in a huge team vs. AI encampments/bases, or just get flipping rich with selling apples. there's something for everyone out there.

But i don't want to hail everythig into the sky here, so here's a few negatives, which imo you should kow before you buy this:

-This game is in NO regards something for people lookig for a run & gun game. It's a Mil Sim after all.
-With the milsim aspect comes the complication of finding key bindings for everything you want to be able to do. so be preapared to learn buttloads of them (Especially with TFAR and ace in play).
-The graphics may look BRILLIANT on a good rig but if you are on minimum specs prepare for some frame problems,
 especially on bigger servers (although i have to say BI optimized a lot with the last few updates)

But other then that i can really just recommend this game if you are into military shooters that own you huge piles of different stuff.

And since my ""N"" key is fucked, here are some Ns for you guys that made it this far: n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n
That should've made up for the missed ones.

76561198030752353,107410,True,0.973724424839019775,"Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that it‚Äôs developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But it‚Äôs even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. 

At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the game‚Äôs complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your ass depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. 

Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3‚Äôs two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as I‚Äôm stuck on one mission that I simply can‚Äôt seem to complete.)

However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves.

Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). I‚Äôm sure there are so many others that I haven‚Äôt even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game.

In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless.

76561198031889408,107410,True,0.958130419254302979,"Been playing ARMA for almost 10 years now. It‚Äôs grown alongside me, and has created some of the most memorable moments I‚Äôve ever experienced in a videogame. It‚Äôs one of those games which, when it finally ‚Äòclicks‚Äô with you, never quite leaves you. You always find yourself going back to it. It‚Äôs not a game which necessarily empowers you like DOOM or Wolfenstein, but the pay-off from successfully pulling off that mission, that flank, that firing solution, that landing, even that single shot, is unparalleled. 

I‚Äôll always remember the moody fog of the APEX Protocol co-op missions as me and my friend crawled through the jungle, silently taking out patrols hunting for us with flashlights dancing in the dark. I‚Äôll always remember finally Escaping from Tanoa after six hours with my mates ‚Äî it felt like a hiking trip by the end. I‚Äôll always remember staying prone in a ghillie suit as a whole platoon of Russians patrolled past my squad, just like in All Ghillied Up. No other game can recreate the thrill or complexity of these memories in an emergent and inherently personal manner. 

My friends and I, after ten years, have talked for hours about that one mission which went so wrong or that incredible shot one of us made across a whole valley, or just how much we associate some terrains like Sahrani or Stratis with our first years as teenagers back at school. ARMA, for me, is an experience equal in its thrills and frustrations as it is in its nostalgia ‚Äî you come to learn these towns, these fields, these roads and valleys and recall them each as affectionately as the other. Sure, things go wrong: a miscommunication is made, a helicopter crashes, the physics engine freaks out, or the server messes up, but most of the time, you‚Äôll laugh through it. 

ARMA is unlike any other game ‚Äî any other experience. I think this ramble has been quite open in displaying just how much it means to me, and how much it will continue to mean to me. I can assure you, if you give it a chance, it will quickly mean as much to you too."

+ Extremely mod friendly; enjoys full support from the Steam Workshop
+ Visuals & environmental design, save for a few issues here and there (i.e. empty buildings), has largely aged well & looks fantastic
+ Employs a deeply challenging level of realism
+ Multiplayer is still very active; boasts a wonderful variety of gameplay & modded servers to choose from
+ Long, content-packed single player campaign; player choices do affect potential endings, as there are several
+ Time control is back from Arma 2; player can speed up the passage of time, which helps SIGNIFICANTLY to combat the monotony of walking/running very long distances between objectives
+ Enormous map/playable area
+ User-created scenarios & a very easy-to-use scenario creator
+ Boasts incredibly varied gameplay mechanics; from piloting/driving myriad vehicles & gunships, to underwater missions, & everything in-between
+ Map & squad mechanics are back; while they may feel clunky to use in a combat scenario, a little practice goes a long way & serves to open up a slew of options on the battlefield

- Sound design is very hit & miss; some weapons sound identical to others, & vehicle sound effects tend to sound strangely muted
- Dialogue is also hit & miss; while I found the voice-acting to be done largely well, some of the dialogue is a bit awful
- Soundtrack often felt cheesy or inappropriate
- Mission pacing often feels very uneven; I felt that it often leaned too far into the realm of the tedious in the interest of realism (shouldn't be a bad thing in theory, but for the pruposes of a video game, it can put players to sleep in some missions)
- The initial learning curve is considerable, & the tutorial felt inadequate overall; mechanics are amazing on paper, but take an inordinate amount of time to master

Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality. There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release.

One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s.

As we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon. We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols. Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower.

There I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower. I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position. But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed.

As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive.

Falling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command. I had done it. I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive.

That is what this game is about."

What Im trying to say is: ARMA is not a game, simulation or the answer to the question: How can I commit a war crimes but not be punished for it. Its the friends we made a long the way to commit those war crimes, every flipped convoy that ruins the operation 15 minutes from starting, its the AI shooting your though 30 layers of foliage, its the enemy artillery firing once but the shell exploding 6  times over a 3km radius, every new guy throwing a grenade under your feet while you play dress up in the arsenal, laughing your ass off as your Zeus tries to spice things up with roll playing, crying as Zeus retaliates for killing his roll play doll for ""lols"", every insane AT shot made by one of your guys, every terribly fired RPG you did, its every time the AI some how flanked you and every time you fight your way though it.

edit: this is a cry for help"
76561198007471493,107410,True,0.94609987735748291,"Where do I start with Arma 3...

 1st of all, have I played enough of this game? No, not in the slightest. My total playtime (see above) is pathetic in comparison to those around me. I see upwards of 2000, 3000, 4000 hours just looking at the reviews currently. At the time of writing this review, I sit on a measly 61 hours of gameplay, so I am in no way an expert of this game. 

 What I CAN  tell you is that there are moments in that 61 hours of gameplay that I will probably never forget. This game makes you feel things you won't feel in any other shooter. Call of Duty thrives on high adrenaline, rapid paced combat. Battlefield slows it down a bit, but maintains a good balance of action and spacing between engagements. 

 Arma 3 is a completely different ballpark. There is a LOT of spacing between engagements, which adds massive suspense and makes every firefight very, very meaningful. When combat initiates, there is definately adrenaline pumping action, but it's not fast. Combat is very slow, almost methodical (just like real life) but very, very... awesome. Some things that you'll see in an Arma firefight that you will not see anywhere else:
 - Engagements will be very long distance, often hundreds of meters away, especially if you're roaming the hills or open wilderness. Enemies may only be a fleck in your scope, on another hill entirely, several football fields away from you.
 - You often won't know where you're getting shot from if you're taken by surprise. You don't get any indicators that say ""Hey! someone to your left just shot you!"". Instead, you'll be forced to take cover and locate the enemy the old fashioned way: watching and listening.
 - If you get shot, you probably wont have time to react. One or two shots will kill you without much warning.
 - Teamplay is CRUCIAL. Medics, Anti-Tank, Heavy Gunners all have a part to play in their teams success. 
 - Communication on a whole other level. There is a radio/audio system in the game that is essential to a squad's success. Squad leaders will be vocal, squadees must be willing to take orders and communicate with their superioirs. Directions will not be called out like ""LEFT! RIGHT!"" but rather with compass bearings such as ""There's at least 3 of them at... 248""
 - Stand/Crouch/Prone is also at another level entirely. You can also hunch over, stand up super tall, sit down, lean on your side, bend your body left and right etc.. Manipulating these stances and using them to show as little of you as possible may be a key factor on whether you live or die
 - Every move you make has a pro and a con attached to it. Fire your weapon? Might kill someone, but you might also give your position away or get shot as you peak out of cover. Forget to look left? Arma teaches that wherever you don't look, there will be something that kills you.
 - NO HITMARKERS. You have to make your own call as to whether or not the guy you just shot is dead. If you make the wrong call, your squad may advance only for one of them to be shot by a (very much alive) enemy solider
 - Tanks and armored vehicles are terrifying. It's not like Battlefield where a tank shows up, everybody continues their daily routines and hopefully somebody with anti tank weaponry deals with the 15 ton chunk of metal. Armored vehicles are terrifyingly powerful with weapons foot soldiers can only dream of. A whole squad of 20 people will immediately hit the deck if one of them shpws up, hoping that their AT guys can do the job because...
  - You don't respawn back into the heat of battle. You reaspawn in a base in the middle of nowhere and you either have to take a helicopter to meet with your squad, or ""HALO jump"", which teleports you to an exaxct location but 6000 feet up in the sky, forcing you to have to use your parachute to land safely. HALO jumping back into combat is suicide. Big shiny glorified baloons make really, really good target practice. That also means...
  - If you lose that aforementioned anti-tank guy, you're hooped unless someone takes the risk and picks the launcher off his dead body. That is, unless the tank/armored car blows him up before he gets there. Then 20 people are stranded with very little to do, which means...
 - Every life counts.

 The combat is unreal. I remember we had to clear this city of enemies, entirely. It took us upwards of an hour, but  we checked every single building, room by room, until, In the center plaza, there he stood; the last man we had to kill. All the other building were checked, and I saw a head poking out behind this obstacle in the dead center of the city,

 ""I found him!"" I yell over the squad's radio, ""Central Garden, straight north"" I notice he pokes his head around the corner. My assault rifle was depleted.

 I knew I should have packed more flipping ammo.
 
 So I pull out my pistol. Fire, miss, fire, miss, rinse andrepeat. I empty my whole clip and the man is not dead. So I reload, and just start Terminator walking my way towards this guy. Firing every round I have. The guy doesn't poke his head out anymore. One clip exhausted, then another. And another. This guy will not die. I least I'm supressing him. 

 Then he pops around, shoots me once. Dead.

 My squad catches up ""What the hell was all that shooting?!"" the commander expresses.
 
 They grenade him. Dead.

 Wish I'd have thought of that sooner. 

 The medic gives me a nice repair. I borrow some mags off of him. We get on the chopper, talking about how wicked that mission was. We get a new one, something about planting a bomb somewhere.

 At this point the squad has bonded. We knew eachothers names, at least. We just kept talking, getting closer to the LZ, mocking the pilot for driving too low to the ground. We land and immediately, the chopper comes under fire.

 ""RUN! SPREAD OUT!""

 The heli blows up before it can leave. We all die in a blaze of glory.

 And I left the game after that.

 I cannot recommend this game enough."
76561198176296555,107410,True,0.944918155670166016,"I spent several years in the army and I gotta say this game is spot on with the training and atmosphere the military provides. I love how difficult this game is, and I love all of the different features the game provides. It is NOT easy to hit a target with an assault rifle from 300 yards in real life, and this game seems to match that same difficulty. Fatigue is a real thing and it seriously hinders your accuracy in real life...Arma 3 makes you stop and catch your breath if you run too far or carry too much gear, or you will have a hard time hitting your target. Enemies are not stupid and they have great vision. I was engaged by two enemies from about 200 yards away and they were using bushes for cover as well as 3-5 second rushes when moving. The AI is more advanced than the average taliban are in real life. haha :p Given my love for the military and for videogames, this one is definitely one of my favorites of all time :D"
76561198130981093,107410,True,0.943312287330627441,"I'm not into arma anymore, but as you can probably tell from the amount of hours I've spent paying this game; I've had an incredible time.

Most of the hours clocked into this game have been spent on roleplay servers. They were so fun back in the day..people weren't too serious, and neither too silly. It was very balanced, very fun. Very replayable.

But arma ain't all about roleplay, so let's talk about other things:

I'll start with combat mechanics, obviously - as the game is all about fighting lol. 
The combat is ABSOLUTELY FLIPPING GREAT! You got things like bullet drop which keeps you on your game, and other things such as weapons becoming less effective as the bullet travels mid-air..you also have very aweosme-looking postures which you can adopt; from laying prone, to sitting on your bum, to crouching, leaning side-to-side, and all dat weird jazz.

It's also very realistic in that, you can only take 1-5 shots before you die pending on which weapon is used against you and what kind of protective gear you have equipped. This means that you have to be VERY careful in-game, otherwise you might just get shot in the head and die. Personally, I enjoy such hardcore mechanics.
Another hardcore mechanic is how damage taken is based on where you are hit on your body. So if you've been shot in the head, you're likely to take a hell of a lot of damage, and this is where armour becomes a huge importance; without armour, you are as vulnerable as a mouse surrounded by a horde of cats. I shouldn't even need to stress how much you need armour! You can go light, or heavy - your choice. The amount you wear does affect movement speed though, so do be careful of that. It also affects how badass you look; I generally like to go light so I look like a badass mofo who is totally capable of destroying anyone who crosses my path lol. Not only that, but your appearance can also affect how easily an enemy can spot you. So if you have a huge bag on your back, and lightly coloured clothes- you can be sure people will spot you with ease.

So yeah. Useful information there, I know. But I am most certainly not done! We have to talk about the tanks, and the awesome vehicles that can totally blow ur balls off!

In arma, there are about 20 different ground vehicles, all unique in both appearance and purpose. You have a few anti-vehicle tanks, a few anti-people tanks, and a few artillery and anti-air tanks. Personally, I love the artillery....they're like mini nukes lol. 

You also have APPACHI ATTACK HELICTOPERS! I mean who doesn't like that!? And some awesome looking submarines and attack planes..and boats :):)
AND CARS WITH MOUNTED TURRETS ON!

Yeah, long-story-short -- arma has tons of vehicles, all awesome in both appearance and nature. Very useful for committing mass-genocide on dem pesky capitalist NATO forces....mmmm, satisfactory

Also sorry for not listing their names. I no good wit dat :(:(

Arma also has lots of game modes to choose from, so you're not restricted to just playing one gamemode and getting bored after an hour. I believe I've already listed one already; roleplay. Others include but are not limited to(due to custom game modes etc); TDM, KOH, KTF, PLAYER VS AI(forgot the official classification, sorry), 5v5 COMPETITIVE MATCHES (like that csgo competitive game mode), custom zombie modes, and survival modes. There are also singleplayer game modes which you can host, such as Zeus or custom Addons which allow for various different gameplay experiences; which brings me to my next topic...

There are loads of mods available on the steam workshop! From halo mods, to Star Wars, to enhanced combat system and mechanic mods, xcom mods, and various others which add more vehicles, factions, armour/clothing, more ai, etc...

The settings menus are also vast and fleshed out in arma, so you can rest assured that you'll be able to configure almost anything you want. 
The game also doesn't require a very high-tier computer to function nominaly, so lag shouldn't really be a problem; especially if you tune down the graphics via the settings menus a bit.

This'll be the last topic within this review; multiplayer.
Multiplayer is obviously a huge part of the game, as I've briefly mentioned previously(with the game modes). This game is almost solely multiplayer-based, but singleplayer is a thing and can be fun, so don't feel restricted. This game being focused mainly on multiplayer is obviously good for playing with friends. You can have much fun playing with friends online in this game, much fun indeed. Lag can be a problem though, so make sure you have a decent internet connection and don't be disappointed if you can't play with a friend based half way across the world from you :) but personally I feel the devs have really improved connectibility over the passed years in terms of multiplayer. Id say it's currently at its peak.

Check this game out. It's relatively cheap for its value, so I advise such.

Apologies if I've missed some flavourful features or mechanics. I'll definitely be sure to edit this review if anyone comes in screaming at me about how I didn't include ""this and that and this and that and this and that"" lol.

We're on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back. I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing.

     Now that I am at almost 730 hours played at the time of this review's initial publication I thought it was time for me to review my favorite game. This is not going to be a typical review where they say something along the lines of ""swam in the air, 79 out of 10 would be break laws of physics again,"" although that has happened to me and it was hilarious. This is going to be an in depth and honest review of Arma 3.

First though, here is some context.

      When Arma 3 first came out in 2013 I was so excited because I had been watching Arma 2 for so long and I was really hyped on the Arma 3 trailers, not that I actually had a good enough computer to play either one of them of course, so I waited until I finally did. I waited for 3 1/2 years watching YouTube videos and wishing that I could have Arma 3, It was sheer torment. All the cool things that people did just made the situation worse: every valiant last stand against zombies that saved the city, every stealth mission that crippled the enemy, and every close air support gun run that saved a convoy that was under threat just made me want Arma 3 more. So, when I finally had a computer that was good enough to play games on it one of the first games that I got was Arma 3.

       Arma 3 was nothing like I had expected it to be, it was better. An entire virtual sandbox for me to do anything I wanted, go anywhere I wanted, and play any way I wanted. It was not like a ""sophisticated Battlefield"" or a ""Call of Duty on steroids"" like I was expecting it to be, or how I was told it was. Arma 3 is just better. Those descriptions don't even remotely do the game justice. The modding support is astounding to say the least, like I said earlier, zombies. The maps are gorgeous, the weapons are wonderfully modeled, and you have a fully customizable character from the face, to the clothes, to the voice. Arma 3 is more than meets the eye, sure it‚Äôs beautiful, but it also has a great deal of depth behind that gorgeous high polygon count tree, and highly reflective water, and I love it to death for it.

       Arma 3 is in some ways the next logical step for somebody who is into the first person shooter genre, you probably don't know what they say about the game but here it is anyway. ""Children play Call of Duty, boys play Battlefield, men play Arma."" I feel like this statement is true, at least on some levels. The Arma series just feels mature to me, and much more refined than Call of Duty or Battlefield as well. They are not games where you can easily be a""Super Duper MACV Recon SOG SEAL Delta Force Green Beret CIA Operator,"" go ""gunz blazin,"" and kill ""all dem dudes over dere."" Although that sometimes works much to my own surprise and amusement. Arma 3 requires at least some modicum of strategy, or my personal favorite, a great big helping of luck to win, or even be good at in some cases, and I think that is good thing, Arma demands that people invest time into.

       Arma 3 has a large amount of multiplayer content that somebody can enjoy, you can play on a life server and rise through the ranks to become whoever you want to be, whether you want to be are a brutal crime lord, or the mayor of the town. The king of the hill servers bring a nice challenge to Arma 3 where you can fight in and against, in a perfect world, a well organized group of players who are trying very diligently to accomplish their objectives in Arma 3's virtual world. I loved Arma so much that I decided to found a unit which can be found here: join.crabsunion.com

The choice really is up to you on what you want to do in the game, and the built in mission maker with the option to add a ""Zeus"" for mission changes on the fly is always a great option. It is fun to play God for a while, and terrorize your friends.

       The singleplayer content of Arma 3 is quite good, I am very much enjoying the new ""Stepping Stone"" campaign, where NATO forces are trying to seize the picturesque island of Malden in an attempt to attain and maintain aerial dominance over the critically important Strait of Gibraltar.The ""Apex Protocol Campaign"" is very well made in my opinion with several missions that make you feel like you really are a ""Super Duper MACV Recon SOG SEAL Delta Force Green Beret CIA Operator."" Another great thing about the Apex Protocol campaign is that it gives you the option of playing it with friends if you so choose, something I wish the other campaigns did as well.

       Many people say that Arma 3 has a steep learning curve and I disagree. You pick up new things very quickly in Arma 3, or at least I do. Arma 3 just has so much to learn that many people think that it is a very difficult game to play when it is not. Almost every time I play Arma 3 I learn something new about the game or how to play it more effectively. It does not matter whether this is some knowledge about how to use Zeus or make mission more effectively, if it is some new tactic for clearing houses, or even if it is a technique on how to get more stable frame rate. Even with my amount of play time, and the amount of videos I have watched on Arma 3, I am still learning new things constantly. I believe that fact alone sets Arma 3 apart from other games.

       Arma 3 is a somewhat underappreciated treasure in the gaming world with endless content and unlimited scenarios to explore and it deserves more publicity than it is getting. I hope that this review was helpful to you and informative as well. Furthermore I hope that it didn‚Äôt bore you to death too much. Anyways, you have a great day now."

Great game for the more serious war gamer, not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from Call of Duty series which I consider more for the younger gamers anyway.

Arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games, similar to Battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using. You will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10-20 minutes in a single location (sometimes longer, I personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward.

You will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance.

You can not respawn as quickly as you can in CoD if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic.

The graphics are great, the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to.

I recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible (unless doing paintballing or airgunning), and if you do buy the game - I recommend completing the whole VR Tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the Campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game."

August 20th 2019. I was in a Squad of 7 men. I had the duty of a combat life saver. We had to fly oversea's on a Helicopter. I couldn't tell if my pilot was drunk or my dial up internet was making the helicopter do acrobatics but it was intense. About 5 minutes of flying we touch down safely, getting out as my ears immediately explode from my sound mod making the helicopter 5000x louder. It was awesome. We continue down the road for another 200m when a sniper from the treeline blows off one of my boys heads. We all scramble for cover behind the hill. My boy and I had to kill the MMG who were suppressing our men. We take a flank to the left in hopes of gunning this asshole down. Because the AI are fucking superman, me and my boy were immediately spotted and suppressed by sniper fire behind a rock. He gets hit in the chest which caused a velocity wound and other medical wounds. I sew him up like the god I am and we continue down the hill under all sorts of fire. I take a bullet to my arm and leg, making me as slow as a 60 year old asthmatic hippo with 3 legs. I stitch up my wounds and began limping to some more cover. I fix my leg somehow and im mobile again, pushing into the objective we were supposed to take an hour ago. Our NATO squad successfully raided the base. Only 2 men were killed and all CSAT have been eliminated.

Or so we thought.

The man on the radio sounds like his balls dropped off Mount Everest. He tells us CSAT reinforcements will be arriving shortly. I was unprepared with only 3 mags of ammunition and only a few medical bandages and morphine left. After a few minutes of respite, a shot is echoed from the hills and another firefight takes place again. These assholes now have armored cars with .50 guns on them. 4 of our men are killed within seconds. Thankfully i brought AT rockets with me and I take out the armored car. It explodes in a fiery mess, leaving that area scorched. My boy and I take cover behind a shitty jeep as more and more bullets fly over our heads. He gets hit in the chest 2 times and in the leg 3. I'm out of ammunition in both weapons and I am forced to drag him behind a tree. I take a hit to my chest and start to bleed out. Medical supplies are running thin. 

A few minutes passed and the CSAT have stopped firing. They probably thought we all died. I failed to medic my friend as his cold, dead body lay in the grass. I scavenge off my dead teammates for ammo, leaving my aim in the garbage due to the multiple wounds to the arms. Just when I thought all was over, a NATO chopper has came to evacuate me. I have a blood pressure of the exact definition of trash, my heart rate is 50 and my screen is black and white. I'm limping up a hill while taking multiple shots from the CSAT hiding in the thick brush. I am able to get into the chopper and escape as the last man in my squad to live. 

From that day on, I have diagnosed myself with PTSD. Only play if your balls are made of titanium."

76561198123083438,107410,True,0.926028549671173096,"For this review I'm going to open with a price breakdown, because at the end of the day when you're looking at getting a game you're trying to figure out whether or not it's worth it.

[h1]Price Breakdown[/h1]
Full price of the game and all DLC without deals or bundles $200.25

With my 4,000 hours of gameplay that equates to
 $0.0502375 an hour of playtime (Or about 5 cents)
 $1.2057 a day of playtime

Days between 1 August 2016 (When I bought it) and 12 March 2020 (date of this review)
That's 1,319 days or 31,656 hours
 $0.00632581501137225170583775587566‚Ä¨ an hour (or about half a cent)
 $0.15181956027293404094010614101592 a day (Or about 15 cents)


Arma is a near future military sandbox experience that gives players access to play how they want, whether they want to be infantry, tank operators, war journalists, helicopter pilots, jet pilots, boat captains, divers. Arma has something to suit any players wants.

[h1]Are the DLCs worth it?[/h1]
So when we're looking at value it is well worth it. I often run into people going on in lobbies about how Arma is always bringing out DLCs that cost way too much for what they are and that Bohemia is just a moneyhungering company, but when you break it down the level of detail they bring to the table and the time you spend on the content is unparalleled in terms of replayability. Aside from the singleplayer campaigns and the maps introduced in DLCs all of the content is actually free to use whether you own the DLC or not, the only downside is that if you do use something that you don't own the DLC for then a watermark will show up on the side of your screen for a few seconds every five to ten minutes or so.

It seems that in many peoples eyes the most cardinal sins are the Contact DLC and Laws of War DLC. But I only ever hear complaints about them from people that when I get into debates with them they say 'Oh, I forgot Arma had a singleplayer."" or ""Pfffft, no one plays the singleplayer."" But this last statement couldn't be more wrong. In fact in terms of parts of this game that shine, the singleplayer campaigns and missions are a big part of that.

[h1]Singleplayer[/h1]
The way the tutorial seemlessly blends into the story of the larger campaign, to the political turmoil you find yourself being embroiled in, to the intrigue of the moral dilemmas you find yourself asking at the end of the Laws of War campaign. These stories are memorable! If you ever dip your hands in the Zeus gamemode (the veritable Dungeons and Dragons of the Armaverse) you'll often find yourself recreating some of those memorable experiences for other players, such as the uneasy downtime and that suspenseful few moments before a major gunfight.

[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]
If singleplayer isn't your thing then the multiplayer will keep you coming back again and again, whether you want to have a PVP killfest in King of the Hill, a PVE mission based gamemode in Invade and Annex or Antistasi, the aforementioned Zeus gamemode, a roleplay experience in ArmaLife servers, or a hardcore military simulation. Arma has it all. When it comes to the multiplayer, most of my most enjoyable moments have been the downtime in between missions, whether chilling at the base or traveling to the area of operations. Arma multiplayer is a social experience at heart and that's where the multiplayer experience really shines in my eyes. I have met many people over the years that I am still good friends with to this day, and I have Arma to thank for that. We have had good times together and even better stories to tell. When I was first playing this game I didn't have a microphone so I had to type everything I wanted to get across, because of that I inadvertently learnt touch typing, which is pretty strange to say when someone asks you how you learnt to touch type. The official servers can become quite chaotic, but if you find a nice server a community is hosting then that can be like a second home, even with some of the chaotic people in the official servers the community as a whole is the most welcoming community I've come across in a game.

[h1]Community[/h1]
Touching on the community, Arma has a strong and committed modding and content creation community, mainly due to the passion of the users and the easy to use modding and mission creation tools, such as the 3DEN editor, a 3d mission maker contained within the game itself which harkens back to the golden age of Real Time Strategy games, such as Age of Empires. So if what you want to do isn't quite in the game, you're sure to find a mod or a mission that allows you to do that and if you can't there is an abundance of information on how to make it yourself. And with the easeability of sharing modlists, it's easy to bundle all of the mods you need to make the experience you want to play and then share the list with your mates so that you can all play together.

[h1]Is Arma The Game For You?[/h1]
All in all there is a lot of downtime in this game, so if you're all about instant gratification, killstreaks and being the best of the best then this game probably isn't for you. Arma is a team game and a lot of the game is spent walking, travelling or planning which gives you a lot of time to get to know your team. So if you're not into that then this might not be the game for you when it comes to the multiplayer. If you're looking for a game that is a million different games however, Arma is for you. Because every experience is different and with mods it can even be an entirely different game, for an example just look at DayZ or PlayersUnknownBattlegrounds which both started their lives as mods on Arma.

Arma 3, best 4,000 I've spent in a game ever."
76561198097852352,107410,True,0.925913095474243164,"After putting in over 3500 hours, I have seen the good, the bad, and the downright ugly that ARMA III has to offer. With that being said, I offer my review. It will be a bit long, but after this much time in game, there is a lot to discuss. 

First off, the campaign for single player is ok, but not great. You will be able to find other games with better campaign story modes than ARMA III as the main focus is put on the Multiplayer aspect. However, the campaign and story does prove challenging and the story is solid enough to keep you entertained and engaged. 

Secondly, The DLC content is hit or miss. 

GOOD DLC!
-Tanks add several new tanks into the game and make putting a AP round through your enemy a joy!
-Jets add several new jets to wreak havoc with! It also adds a aircraft carrier!
-Marksman adds some of the best sniper rifles in the game period! Also adds several ghillie suits and scopes. 

Decent DLC.
-Helicopters adds two helis to the game. Mostly for heavy lifting. 
-APEX adds an Island called Tanoa. A dozen weapons and gear. A few vehicles and a few VTOL aircraft. 

Bad DLC!
-Karts. Go-karts on a battlefield. Is this a joke?
-Laws of War. A single player mini campaign for a multiplayer focused game.  Not worth your money.
- Tac-Ops. Again, another single player mini campaign in a multiplayer focused game. Not worth your money.

Third on the list in multiplayer. The true fun to be had with ARMA III is through the multiplayer. There are 1000's of servers all with different options to chose from fitting nearly every type and style of game play. Zombies, they got it. Not into Zombies? No problem. Co-op, yep! Role play, check! Survival, you bet! PvP for those that like to kill others and PvE for the more casual crowd can be found.

Fourth. The community of players found in ARMA III are some of the best I have seen. They are often found to be helpful and willing to lend a hand to newer players and also to veterans in need of assistance. With that being said, you will however run into the occasional troublemaker, rule breaker, or very rarely a hacker. Most of them are dealt with swiftly by the server admins. Then, also,  there is those few players who have little time to read the server rules and blindly run off into the battlefield annoying players by doing things they shouldn't. When corrected by others, they will usually reply "" I didn't know the rules. "" A word of advice. When entering a server, read the rules or simply ask in chat and other players will usually be happy to explain them. 

Fifth, the graphics. For a game that is over 5 years old, the graphics are good. Not great mind you, but good to say the least. 

Sixth, the game play. ARMA III focuses on two things. Realistic militarised game play and multiplayer action via servers. Most of the servers run mods created by people like you and me. Some are about survival and will have you scrounging the map for supplies and gear. Some are about playing team death-match. Some are co-op missions. They can be very fun and can add a lot of vehicles, maps, gear, aircraft, weapons, scenarios, and more to the game. However, no one is prefect and you will find yourself dead periodically after simply opening a door, walking down stairs, entering a vehicle, exiting a vehicle, etc. The point is, expect the unexpected. While this does not happen all the time, you most definitely will encounter a few bugs and glitches from time to time. The most common and frustrating is the sudden vanishing of vehicles left at your base. ARMA loves to eat vehicles for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Also, it will eat your gear, weapons, base, and well....pretty much anything.  So don't get too attached to your stuff. As a server admin for several different servers, I have spent entire days replacing lost items. However, do not expect all admins to be as accommodating as losing items in ARMA is all part of the game.

In all, ARMA III can be a very fun game to play. It's strength comes from the almost limitless ways the game can be played on the 1000's of available servers. After all this time, I still find myself spending the weekends running missions on several servers. In the end, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes realistic military style games."

311 days ago i was Developer banned from Arma 3. The day before i received this ban i had decided to download arma after months away from it. I downloaded the game, it remembered all my mods, downloaded them then i fired the game up.

Do you lads feel out of sorts some times and you sit looking at you vast steam library wondering what to play. Its kinda like choosing a film on Netflix, before you know it times up and you cant be bothered. It was like that. I sat in the in game menu for one minute (screen shot to prove it) before deciding not to play. I exited the game, steam and shut down my PC. 

The following day i decided i was going to fully get back into it. I loaded up my computer. Steam automatically opened but this time with a message. You have been banned from the following games (ARMA 3).

It stated i was banned by the developer. I immediately thought why the hell was i banned. I contacted BI within ten minutes. The response was the same as it remains today. 'we do not deal with bans, battleye do. Please contact battleye if you need support with a ban.' 

BUT YOU DO DEAL WITH BANS - THIS IS A DEV BAN NOT A BE BAN????

I spent the last 10 months contacting BE who eventually responded to tell me that they did not ban me nor did they find anything on my PC that was suspicious to them at the time of my ban. They informed my my logs were 'spotless'

I swung my attention back around to BI. I contacted them the other day. A chap called Dominik responded saying the ban was a battleye ban not a DEV ban.  I have since sent him images of my ban stating it was a DEV ban, steams explanation of a DEV BAN which states a developer informs valve of an account that is suspicious and valve ban them. I have sent images of my conversation with BE and proof that in the two weeks before my ban i had one minute of game time which was spent in the menu. 

The emails have fallen of deaf ears.....No response from Dominik. 

I am absolutely heart broken that from the past 10 months i have been unable to play with my friends and it looks like this situation is not going to change. I am disgusted as the lack of acknowledgement and willingness to support and resolve this from BI. 

I have so many fond memories in Arma 2, OH & 3 but it looks like this is the end of the road for me. I will miss the random chats in game, the communities i was part of and the battles of the field.

76561198061912275,107410,True,0.910561800003051758,"Arma 3 is like that long-term girlfriend/boyfriend you date where, at the honeymoon phase, you are smitten and are like ""wow, this is a 10/10 unique experience."" However, as the months turn to years and time rolls on, you start to realize there are shinier, prettier experiences out there- better looks, sexier moves, more stable, but you stick with it. You realize you're really with a solid 7/10, but **** is it fun. There are things he/she can do that no one else can, and well, despite deviations time to time to fantasize about other experiences, and several on-again/off-again times spent dabbling in those fantasies, you find yourself coming back to him/her. You find yourself truly happy...even after the worst (and unstable) times. Come to think of it, maybe this isn't a healthy relationship, but at the end of the day, it's a **** fun one.

Arma is an unstable, buggy ride and a bit overwhelming on first impressions, but it's an experience that you don't get in any other sandbox game or military shooter. The community is really what drives this game. It's a quasi-sim/quasi-arcade experience that can be tailored to the community/user's need given a little time spent learning how it all works. The developers do a decent job of providing documentation to understand how content creation and mission editing functions, and the community fills (and exceeds) the areas unfulfilled and self-imagined. There are few communities as diverse and robust as Arma's. In one night's events, you can go from playing a modern-day military sim night with your homies, to WWII, Vietnam, then Star Wars, Halo, Starship Troopers, Aliens, to the bloody revolutionary war and more. In short, Arma should be judged more as a sandbox & framework for community addons than a game on its own, and one that over the last 6 years developed into being highly accessible to the average user without even needing to touch a text editor or understand how it works to get custom games going through its implementation of a ""Dungeon Master"" style mission builder called ""Zeus."" Arma's experience varies greatly depending on your level of tolerance for troubleshooting and patience with searching/installing addons. 

This is best experienced by being dragged in by a community of friends... really it's kind of Stockholm Syndrome that kept me in it to start, and the incredible, fun, sometimes frustrating, and hilarious experiences made along the way is something no other game has offered and keeps me coming back. Give it a go, or watch some communities stream their experiences and see for yourself."

I struggle to think of many games past or present that manage to do what Arma 3 does. Before the impending praise I'm about to give this game I will say 2 things. 

First, there will be bugs. Not the Starship Troopers kind... Well actually you can kill bugs as a Starship Trooper but I'm talking glitches, rubber banding, inventory issues, layer upon layer of mods causing compatibility issues and the list goes on. You simply have to embrace these problems and make them part of the enemy which you have to overcome! If you are easily put off by the above, Arma isnt for you, in fact the way games are pushed out these days a don't think many games would be for you.

Second, so far I have spent ¬£150 on this game (not including money spent on my own private server endeavours and donations to other public server communities) which sounds and is slightly ridiculous HOWEVER I have spent over 6000 hours on this game which is more than the rest of my steam library combined so as a time spent versus money paid its the cheapest game I've ever bought. All I say to anyone who somehow doesn't own it yet is wait for a Steam super sale and buy everything in one nice discount and your laughing!

The above remain the only 2 reasons I would not recommend this game, price Inc all dlc and the constant battle with bugs etc. All that aside Arma 3 is simply one of the best things you can buy for your PC. From the seemingly infinite Steam Workshop content to the fact that you can do anything from Milsim team based combat to simple PvP to cooperative missions to RPG style game modes to racing mods and a small off shoot you may have heard of called DayZ (Arma 2 mod but ya know what I'm getting at) it really does tick every box. There is a huge learning curve in the form of keybindings. It takes time just finding the right section to rebind keys but once you are comfortable I find the control of your character, chopper, jet, quad bike, humvee, tank, golf caddy etc quite intuitive. No other game gives you as many stances to be in. You can literally find a stance which gives you line of sight through a small hole in a wall at any angle. There are basic and advanced settings for flying so you can feel like a pro or take it easy with simplified physics and controls.

One final word... Community! As with all games you are bound to find trolls and people too competitive to remember what manners are, however on the whole Arma has a great community of players. I play 90% coop missions these days and it is just a breath of fresh air to be playing multiplayer on such a grand scale without this furious and frantic atmosphere which is so prominent in most multilayer games these days. After the demise of the Battlefield franchise after BC2 and BF3 I really needed a game to fill my need for military shooters and Arma 3 came to my rescue.

Rather than go on and on, all I will end on saying is that this game is more like a template for you to then decide what you actually want to spend your time doing. If you are on the fence, browse the workshop and see the sheer amount of 5 star community made content from overhaul mods to subtle quality of life mods. You could spend 6000 hours just playing all the single player campaigns made by other users."

Crowd around, children, it's story time.

One day, not so long ago, my squad had just destroyed an anti-air battery. Our pilot landed, and the rest of the squad boarded one by one. I was about to get in when the rockets started flying.

The chopper lifted off, with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes. Unwilling to die before then, I rushed to the nearest cover, a small house by a narrow road. I entered to find a ten year-old player who had also been left behind. He explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his ""clan"".

I politely declined, explaining that my own squad was inbound. As I finished, a Ghost Hawk flew over the horizon. My squad had arrived.

This noble child soldier and I were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting. The sniper screamed as a 6.5 mm cartridge entered his leg. His shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as I climbed in the transport.

My new friend was dead.

Grossly outdated graphics engine, poorly optimised, it remains the closest game you can ever play to the real thing. During its heyday, milsim communities and modders made this more of an experience than some simple combat simulator - I was able to don exactly the same equipment, uniform and loadouts that I served with while in the army.
NOT worth it if you're playing vanilla arma - terrifying and immersive if you use mods.
You can eat, climb walls, abseil, drink, splint fractures, dress burns, dig foxholes, engage in melee, interrogate, be suppressed and find yourself in a house being breached and cleared by the enemy.
Unless it's vanilla...

76561197971414496,107410,True,0.896043360233306885,"Arma 3 is a tricky game to review, but here‚Äôs me trying it anyway.

The reason why this game is so hard to review lies in the sheer size of the game and the variety of things it may or may not offer for the player.

I take Arma 3 for what it is first and foremost: a platform. What you get is a good looking game with a solid (would be great, but you have to do some optimization to boost your performance) engine, two amazing maps (Stratis and Altis, which is probably the most impressive map I‚Äôve seen in any open world-ish game) and the prospect of near endless new content from the community.

What you don‚Äôt get is an easy to get into mil-shooter with CoD sized maps and a quick pace. If you‚Äôre in for uncomplicated, fast paced PvP gameplay, you should probably look elsewhere. If you‚Äôre sick of that, however, Arma 3 might be just your thing. 

The strength of the Arma series is freedom (**** yeah). You are free to mod the game into almost anything you want, create any type of mission and make your very own gameplay experience. You have to invest some time into the game, but once you got into it, the opportunities are endless.

Want to play huge adversial or coop maps with a hundred players or more?  Arma is just your thing and there are big communities (in many different languages) that will help you find that epic experience.

Want to play singe player? Well, if you expect strong single player content with interesting characters and storyline and so on, then Arma 3 isn‚Äôt the game you‚Äôre looking for.  Or is it? Right now Bohemia delivered one part of a three part campaign ‚Äì those missions are challenging, offer a solid variety of infantry gameplay but don‚Äôt expect a good story or interesting characters. But as mentioned before ‚Äì the huge amount of community made missions and mods offer hours and hours of playtime.

Personally I prefer small cooperative missions to play with friends. Already the steam workshop has countless missions for 2-5 players. 

So, should you buy Arma 3? Well, I‚Äôd certainly recommend it, if any of the things I mentioned above sounds fun to you. It is to say though, that this game is not something that everyone might like, so stay away from it if you are not willing to invest some time into it.

I hope that this review helped some people to decide whether or not they should by Arma 3. Please note that I‚Äôm not a native English speaker, so the language used in this review might seem a little odd for some."

Briefly, I remember that every single second I've played this game is my favorite memory. As I do so, the developer's splash screen flashes on the screen, followed by the warm  welcome of the ARMA III logo and subsequent main menu screen. In this moment, I feel happy and fulfilled. The events of the real world bear no importance to me as I undertake the task of deciding what I'm going to get myself into today. Shall it be Altis life antics? Do I recreate the Osama Bin Laden raid with my friends? Should I attempt to put myself into the shoes of a Marine in the middle of the Tet Offensive of late 1968?

[b] Welcome to Arma 3: The Big One [/b]

If you didn't just start PC gaming an hour ago, you've probably heard of Arma 3. Every time someone says the names Call of Duty, Battlefield, Squad, Red Orchestra, Verdun, or any other shooter title out there, they do so in hushed tones and with their hands over their mouths for fear of the inevitable tongue-lashing they're about to receive from an Arma fan.
Fans of the Arma series are fiercly loyal and totally uncompromising. I have little doubt you've heard the following phrases:

[list]
[*]""If you want [i] realism, [/i] you should play Arma.""
[*]""Only casuals play. . . .""
[*]""Arma 3 is way better because . . . .  and  . . . . ""
[/list]

It's annoying and inarguably elitist but, in their defense, also mostly true. Arma 3 is not for someone who is looking for a casual shooter experience. Arma 3 is for those of us that want to camp out in the trees, waiting for the three guys you saw 30 minutes before, and hoping you can pull of a successful ambush quickly, quietly, and without getting hit. Then, walking for another 30 minutes to link up with another squad, grab some vehicles, and truck a few kilometers out to set up a new FOB. You can expect to go upwards of 3 hours without firing a shot on certain servers.

Which brings me to my next point. . . 

[b] The Game Within a Game Within a Game Within a Game. . . . [/b]

One of A3's major selling points is it's massive, active, dedicated, and diverse community of modders. Arma 3 has a great single player campaign and a few nice King of the Hill and Wasteland servers that you will want to visit occasionally, but Arma gets particularly interesting when you go mod shopping. 

in the mood to lose track of 30 hours while you're dodging police officers and rival gangs as you fight to expand your criminal empire across Altis and/or Tanoa?
Asylum 'Life' servers are a personal favorite of mine. Complete with a living, player-driven economy, impactful politics between gangs and a police force trying to keep control of the island as these gangs throw lead and shade at one another in a constant struggle for turf. If that sounds familiar to you, make no mistake, GTA V doesn't come close to touching the complexity of Life servers.

There are mods for different eras of warfare, gamemodes for about anything you can imagine, and you can find most of them on Steam Workshop, making it easy to access and giving you infinite playtime. You literally cannot run out of things to do because there is [i] always [/i] more content.

I could honestly write about Arma all evening but I'll leave you with a few pros and cons and then I'll wrap things up for you.

[b] PROS: [/b]
[list]
[*]Infinite play value, you can never run out of content
[*]satisfying and memorable moments come to those with patience
[*]game modes for almost everything thanks to the modding community
[*]great graphics for excellent immersion
[*]Endless selection of weapons, vehicles, gear, etc.
[*]Shed your 'casual' title and pick up the mark of 'master' gamer
[/list]

[b] CONS: [/b]
[list]
[*]Arma 3 is not well optimized and is very CPU intensive. Still perfectly playable at 30fps though you will need a high end i7 if you expect to get anywhere near 60fps on most multiplayer servers. AMD users be warned.
[*]Seriously not for casual gamers. I cannot stress this enough. It can take hours to accomplish simple goals depending on your game mode. Highly satisfying when things come together, though.
[*]Expect to move slowly while learning controls. Arma 3 is a game that uses just about [i] all [/i] of your keyboard and it will take you a while to master.

[b] But Should I Buy It? [/b]

I can't recommend this game enough. But if you're a die-hard Call of Duty fan but you still pick up this title, you're in for a rude awakening. Casual gamers be warned."
76561198072447858,107410,True,0.889115750789642334,"What did you do today? I did walk into a stopsign and died in Arma 3.
Meh.. After 3099 hours and 15000 deaths later it's still a game you will return back to.
Thumbsup all the way."
76561198026803446,107410,True,0.888425886631011963,Just buy it. Look at how many hours I have in this game. It's the best money you'll ever spend. It is all things to all gamers.
76561197995591955,107410,True,0.88792949914932251,"Can't tell you if you should buy it or not, but I can tell you this.
You will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isn't there and lack of content if you're not satisfied with what you have. 
But when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, it's something magical you just can't find in any other game.

Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly.
Arma is a game which you can never called finished. There will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations. 

Hope I expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :)

If you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem!

I'll give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, I've used hundreds of hours on Arma 3 that I would never take back.

That being said, there's a reason why so many players in the review section have 1000+ hours in spite of this. You will simply will not find a game like this anywhere else. 

Now, some people don't care much for the realism, and prefer action-movie esque shooters. That's fine. However, this game shines at gritty realistic firefights. There's nothing glorious about shouting contact reports into the radio, bounding cover to cover, and hoping the next round doesn't have your name on it, but when you're finally back on the bird with your buddies headed home, and you finally feel the sense of relief wash over you.

I have to admit, if you decide to start getting in depth with this game, it will be hard to stop depenending in which gamemode you play on. Life servers =Your done. Once you start progressing from rank to rank you'd never want to stop. This game is amazing, but very addictive to the point where someone like me has 4k hours on it."
76561198049422365,107410,True,0.882125139236450195,"Being an avid ArmA 2 Wasteland/DayZ player back in the day (about 1.5 years ago), I relished the thought of a new ArmA coming out. ArmA 2 was practically uknown until it's popularity was increased by DayZ. I found it interesting to jump into a BI (Bohemia Interactive) title that already had a steady fan-base behind it. Having been about a year since I purchased this game (launch) and over 100 hours of solid gameplay I feel that I can finally write a review that encompasses many of the aspects I have experienced within this game. Now I know what you're thinking: ""$59.99?! This isn't even considered a triple A title! That's like... that's like the price of CoD: Ghosts!"" Now, don't be intimidated by this price, for I can say that off the bat this game is worth a lot more than $59.99. From a value perspective, I found the price to be very reasonable based on the game's content nowadays.

Basically, ArmA is a series of hardcore military simulation; constantly reflecting real-world conditions into a video game. In ArmA 2, I feel that this was it's drawback, for there were certain scenarios where it was realistic to a point of frustration (breaking your leg on a 2 foot fall. It's a game guys, relax). ArmA 3 has found a good balance between an FPS/3rd Person shooter game and realism, making it extremely enjoyable as both a simulator [i] and [/i] a game. I also found that ArmA 3 has very good support for newbies to the series and is able to really engage players into the fun. I imagine it is much easier to get into ArmA 3 than I did ArmA 2 (I can't judge, I'm not new to it). 

The engine is decently optimized and is far less clunkier than the ArmA 2 engine, however rocks are still (and I guess forever will be) broken. Perhaps the game is having difficulty conforming such free player movement with an un-even surface. 

Pro tip: NEVER WALK ON ROCKS UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.

The game also has a variety of content; although players coming over from 2 will notice that there are A LOT less guns. This is partly due to the customization of guns. Instead of having a separate gun for each gun variation (M4A1 HOLO, M4A1 CCO, M4A1) you have a base gun and you are able to add sights, lasers, silencers, flashlights, what have you. However, this is not a full excuse- I feel that there are still a lesser amount of overall GUNS to shoot. Perhaps Bohemia Interactive is trying to fine-tune each gun into the patches as opposed to adding a ton of mediocre weapons simply for variety's sake. What's also very surprisingly good in this game is the Nvidia PhysX that was incorporated. Seeing my transport truck's wheels constantly bumping up and down according to the land under me while I drive troops through the night is oh-so-satisfying as well as, well... realistic! The physics engine has been extremely improved and I quite like it.

I'd like to finally talk about how the guns shoot and how they sound, for this is after all, a big part of the game. Once again I will compare it to ArmA 2, in saying clearly that ArmA 2 featured a more high-pitched ""tappy"" sound when you shot with vertical recoil, while 3 brings a much more deeper, louder shot as well as echo to accompany it as the gun travels backwards into your viewmodel as opposed to upwards. The guns definitely feel better for me, but in the end I'd like to classify this judgment as personal preference.

Lastly, the gamemodes of ArmA 3 are diverse and excellent, my favourite being Wasteland script. I won't go into detail here. There is also King of Hill, DayZ (OF COURSE, but it's MEH) and of course standard operations. Altis Life is also a really sweet one! Check those out if you end up buying.

So yeah, I really like this game and I think that there is so much potential for a growing community. Grab some buddies, hop into Stratis and keep overwatch with some snipers and riflers as you and your team move in through the bushes to grab an objective for more supplies for your squad! Really great game, I'd definitely recommend to any FPS/MILSIM fan! :D"
76561198257508149,107410,True,0.881924927234649658,"Arma 3 taught me that 25 fps is playable.
"
76561197963644421,107410,True,0.881744086742401123,"If you're coming to Arma 3 as an Arma series veteran, you already know what to expect. For the most part, the game hasn't changed since the last installment, but then it's always felt a little bit like Bohemia Interactive are still building on the groundwork laid back in 2001 by Operation Flashpoint, in the world's longest ever game of 'development Buckaroo'. Thankfully, the whole thing has yet to fall to pieces in any significant manner; it's quite happy to continue wobbling uneasily for now.

Arma has a reputation. It's known to be frighteningly obtuse, bewilderingly complex, and often hilariously broken. I can tell you right now that Arma 3 is no different, and absolutely still deserves that reputation. Thankfully, I don't think it's unfair to say that this is the closest an Arma game has come to being 'user friendly'. The controls have been tweaked, and the interface refined a little to accommodate more modern tastes. For these improvements alone, I do recommend it to newcomers to the series over any previous entry.
Coming from any other modern FPS game, it will still take a good few hours of what can feel an awful lot like hard work to get to grips with the controls, but I honestly think Arma 3 will see a far lower 'drop-out rate' of newbies who were frustrated to the point of giving up by the previous games.

At the time of writing, the elephant in the room is the lack of content available. When compared to Arma 2 (which is handsomely bolstered by an array of official expansion packs), the amount of hardware available to play with is frustratingly slim. In many cases, opposing armies are equipped with identical vehicles which get a slightly different paint job at best. For anyone used to the myriad of variants and oddments available in Arma 2, Arma 3 can feel awfully disappointing.
Fortunately, this is alleviated to some extent by the strong mod community. It has long been the case that the best parts of the Arma games are the parts not developed by Bohemia Interactive themselves, and Arma 3 is most definitely continuing this 'tradition'. Nevertheless, I can't help but feel that the game could've done with a few months more time in the oven before full public release.

Speaking of the mod community, I think it's criminal that almost none of the best, near-indispensible mods from Arma 2 have been officially integrated. For a self-professed 'war simulator', Arma 3 is hugely lacking in basic features like being able to rest your weapon on surfaces (even with a visible bipod), or tow damaged vehicles.

For all its flaws, though, Arma 3 is still a blast to play. If you can find a decent group of like-minded gamers with access to a voice-over-net server, you're in for some of the best gaming you'll ever experience. Sure, you'll probably have to load up on mods to satisfy your need for variety. And sure, sometimes the game will crash spectacularly, or the physics engine will flip out and kill you for standing too close to a wall. But when you're standing on a hilltop, looking out over an enemy outpost with your squadmates while a CAS helicopter strafes an enemy APC and spots targets for a distant sniper team; when everything clicks together in the way that only Arma can manage, you'll be glad to have been along for the ride."

76561198019977288,107410,True,0.875654399394989014,"I don't know where to start with this but let's just try:

My first experience with ArmA was with the Operation Flashpoint Series and later on with ArmA 1 (Cold war Assault) and then ArmA 2 (+ all possible Add-Ons).
And i just have to say, that i freakin fell in love with this game (ArmA3) from the very begining.

Sure there were heaves of problems, bugs and shit going wrong at the beginning but i still bought this game as soon as it was availabe (Which should've been like early Alpha or so).

But to explain why i sank over propably 2000 hours of my life into this game:

-Versatility: With the workshop added and all the mod support the game offers, it's just incredible for how long you are able to find new stuff. New Maps, weapons, uniforms, AI-Units, vehicles, helicopers, tanks, etc. etc.

-Versitility: With the ZEUS Modul and the Ed3n Editor you are able to creato soooooo much stuff. You can create YOUR OWN scenarios, and the overview them and change them while playing with zeus. if you play with a few people and you keep changing the missio maker you never ever ever run out of ideas/scenarios to play.

-Versitilititititiy: I think we've bee here before... With the huge mod support theres other beefits aswell. If you are playing onlie you will be able to find all sorts of server. wether you like playing as a lone wolf and kill other players, play in a huge team vs. AI encampments/bases, or just get flipping rich with selling apples. there's something for everyone out there.

But i don't want to hail everythig into the sky here, so here's a few negatives, which imo you should kow before you buy this:

-This game is in NO regards something for people lookig for a run & gun game. It's a Mil Sim after all.
-With the milsim aspect comes the complication of finding key bindings for everything you want to be able to do. so be preapared to learn buttloads of them (Especially with TFAR and ace in play).
-The graphics may look BRILLIANT on a good rig but if you are on minimum specs prepare for some frame problems,
 especially on bigger servers (although i have to say BI optimized a lot with the last few updates)

But other then that i can really just recommend this game if you are into military shooters that own you huge piles of different stuff.

And since my ""N"" key is fucked, here are some Ns for you guys that made it this far: n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n
That should've made up for the missed ones.

Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that it‚Äôs developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But it‚Äôs even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. 

At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the game‚Äôs complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your ass depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. 

Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3‚Äôs two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as I‚Äôm stuck on one mission that I simply can‚Äôt seem to complete.)

However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves.

Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). I‚Äôm sure there are so many others that I haven‚Äôt even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game.

In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless.

76561198031889408,107410,True,0.958130419254302979,"Been playing ARMA for almost 10 years now. It‚Äôs grown alongside me, and has created some of the most memorable moments I‚Äôve ever experienced in a videogame. It‚Äôs one of those games which, when it finally ‚Äòclicks‚Äô with you, never quite leaves you. You always find yourself going back to it. It‚Äôs not a game which necessarily empowers you like DOOM or Wolfenstein, but the pay-off from successfully pulling off that mission, that flank, that firing solution, that landing, even that single shot, is unparalleled. 

I‚Äôll always remember the moody fog of the APEX Protocol co-op missions as me and my friend crawled through the jungle, silently taking out patrols hunting for us with flashlights dancing in the dark. I‚Äôll always remember finally Escaping from Tanoa after six hours with my mates ‚Äî it felt like a hiking trip by the end. I‚Äôll always remember staying prone in a ghillie suit as a whole platoon of Russians patrolled past my squad, just like in All Ghillied Up. No other game can recreate the thrill or complexity of these memories in an emergent and inherently personal manner. 

My friends and I, after ten years, have talked for hours about that one mission which went so wrong or that incredible shot one of us made across a whole valley, or just how much we associate some terrains like Sahrani or Stratis with our first years as teenagers back at school. ARMA, for me, is an experience equal in its thrills and frustrations as it is in its nostalgia ‚Äî you come to learn these towns, these fields, these roads and valleys and recall them each as affectionately as the other. Sure, things go wrong: a miscommunication is made, a helicopter crashes, the physics engine freaks out, or the server messes up, but most of the time, you‚Äôll laugh through it. 

ARMA is unlike any other game ‚Äî any other experience. I think this ramble has been quite open in displaying just how much it means to me, and how much it will continue to mean to me. I can assure you, if you give it a chance, it will quickly mean as much to you too."

[h1]*I recommend this particularly for its multiplayer.[/h1]

+ Extremely mod friendly; enjoys full support from the Steam Workshop
+ Visuals & environmental design, save for a few issues here and there (i.e. empty buildings), has largely aged well & looks fantastic
+ Employs a deeply challenging level of realism
+ Multiplayer is still very active; boasts a wonderful variety of gameplay & modded servers to choose from
+ Long, content-packed single player campaign; player choices do affect potential endings, as there are several
+ Time control is back from Arma 2; player can speed up the passage of time, which helps SIGNIFICANTLY to combat the monotony of walking/running very long distances between objectives
+ Enormous map/playable area
+ User-created scenarios & a very easy-to-use scenario creator
+ Boasts incredibly varied gameplay mechanics; from piloting/driving myriad vehicles & gunships, to underwater missions, & everything in-between
+ Map & squad mechanics are back; while they may feel clunky to use in a combat scenario, a little practice goes a long way & serves to open up a slew of options on the battlefield

- Sound design is very hit & miss; some weapons sound identical to others, & vehicle sound effects tend to sound strangely muted
- Dialogue is also hit & miss; while I found the voice-acting to be done largely well, some of the dialogue is a bit awful
- Soundtrack often felt cheesy or inappropriate
- Mission pacing often feels very uneven; I felt that it often leaned too far into the realm of the tedious in the interest of realism (shouldn't be a bad thing in theory, but for the pruposes of a video game, it can put players to sleep in some missions)
- The initial learning curve is considerable, & the tutorial felt inadequate overall; mechanics are amazing on paper, but take an inordinate amount of time to master

Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality. There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release.

One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s.

As we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon. We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols. Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower.

There I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower. I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position. But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed.

As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive.

Falling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command. I had done it. I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive.

That is what this game is about."

Its the friends we made a long the way to commit those war crimes, every flipped convoy that ruins the operation 15 minutes from starting, its the AI shooting your though 30 layers of foliage, its the enemy artillery firing once but the shell exploding 6  times over a 3km radius, every new guy throwing a grenade under your feet while you play dress up in the arsenal, laughing your ass off as your Zeus tries to spice things up with roll playing, crying as Zeus retaliates for killing his roll play doll for ""lols"", every insane AT shot made by one of your guys, every terribly fired RPG you did, its every time the AI some how flanked you and every time you fight your way though it.

76561198007471493,107410,True,0.94609987735748291,"Where do I start with Arma 3...

 1st of all, have I played enough of this game? No, not in the slightest. My total playtime (see above) is pathetic in comparison to those around me. I see upwards of 2000, 3000, 4000 hours just looking at the reviews currently. At the time of writing this review, I sit on a measly 61 hours of gameplay, so I am in no way an expert of this game. 

 What I CAN  tell you is that there are moments in that 61 hours of gameplay that I will probably never forget. This game makes you feel things you won't feel in any other shooter. Call of Duty thrives on high adrenaline, rapid paced combat. Battlefield slows it down a bit, but maintains a good balance of action and spacing between engagements. 

 Arma 3 is a completely different ballpark. There is a LOT of spacing between engagements, which adds massive suspense and makes every firefight very, very meaningful. When combat initiates, there is definately adrenaline pumping action, but it's not fast. Combat is very slow, almost methodical (just like real life) but very, very... awesome. Some things that you'll see in an Arma firefight that you will not see anywhere else:
 - Engagements will be very long distance, often hundreds of meters away, especially if you're roaming the hills or open wilderness. Enemies may only be a fleck in your scope, on another hill entirely, several football fields away from you.
 - You often won't know where you're getting shot from if you're taken by surprise. You don't get any indicators that say ""Hey! someone to your left just shot you!"". Instead, you'll be forced to take cover and locate the enemy the old fashioned way: watching and listening.
 - If you get shot, you probably wont have time to react. One or two shots will kill you without much warning.
 - Teamplay is CRUCIAL. Medics, Anti-Tank, Heavy Gunners all have a part to play in their teams success. 
 - Communication on a whole other level. There is a radio/audio system in the game that is essential to a squad's success. Squad leaders will be vocal, squadees must be willing to take orders and communicate with their superioirs. Directions will not be called out like ""LEFT! RIGHT!"" but rather with compass bearings such as ""There's at least 3 of them at... 248""
 - Stand/Crouch/Prone is also at another level entirely. You can also hunch over, stand up super tall, sit down, lean on your side, bend your body left and right etc.. Manipulating these stances and using them to show as little of you as possible may be a key factor on whether you live or die
 - Every move you make has a pro and a con attached to it. Fire your weapon? Might kill someone, but you might also give your position away or get shot as you peak out of cover. Forget to look left? Arma teaches that wherever you don't look, there will be something that kills you.
 - NO HITMARKERS. You have to make your own call as to whether or not the guy you just shot is dead. If you make the wrong call, your squad may advance only for one of them to be shot by a (very much alive) enemy solider
 - Tanks and armored vehicles are terrifying. It's not like Battlefield where a tank shows up, everybody continues their daily routines and hopefully somebody with anti tank weaponry deals with the 15 ton chunk of metal. Armored vehicles are terrifyingly powerful with weapons foot soldiers can only dream of. A whole squad of 20 people will immediately hit the deck if one of them shpws up, hoping that their AT guys can do the job because...
  - You don't respawn back into the heat of battle. You reaspawn in a base in the middle of nowhere and you either have to take a helicopter to meet with your squad, or ""HALO jump"", which teleports you to an exaxct location but 6000 feet up in the sky, forcing you to have to use your parachute to land safely. HALO jumping back into combat is suicide. Big shiny glorified baloons make really, really good target practice. That also means...
  - If you lose that aforementioned anti-tank guy, you're hooped unless someone takes the risk and picks the launcher off his dead body. That is, unless the tank/armored car blows him up before he gets there. Then 20 people are stranded with very little to do, which means...
 - Every life counts.

 The combat is unreal. I remember we had to clear this city of enemies, entirely. It took us upwards of an hour, but  we checked every single building, room by room, until, In the center plaza, there he stood; the last man we had to kill. All the other building were checked, and I saw a head poking out behind this obstacle in the dead center of the city,

 ""I found him!"" I yell over the squad's radio, ""Central Garden, straight north"" I notice he pokes his head around the corner. My assault rifle was depleted.

 I knew I should have packed more flipping ammo.
 
 So I pull out my pistol. Fire, miss, fire, miss, rinse andrepeat. I empty my whole clip and the man is not dead. So I reload, and just start Terminator walking my way towards this guy. Firing every round I have. The guy doesn't poke his head out anymore. One clip exhausted, then another. And another. This guy will not die. I least I'm supressing him. 

 Then he pops around, shoots me once. Dead.

 My squad catches up ""What the hell was all that shooting?!"" the commander expresses.
 
 They grenade him. Dead.

 Wish I'd have thought of that sooner. 

 The medic gives me a nice repair. I borrow some mags off of him. We get on the chopper, talking about how wicked that mission was. We get a new one, something about planting a bomb somewhere.

 At this point the squad has bonded. We knew eachothers names, at least. We just kept talking, getting closer to the LZ, mocking the pilot for driving too low to the ground. We land and immediately, the chopper comes under fire.

 ""RUN! SPREAD OUT!""

 The heli blows up before it can leave. We all die in a blaze of glory.

 And I left the game after that.

 I cannot recommend this game enough."
76561198176296555,107410,True,0.944918155670166016,"I spent several years in the army and I gotta say this game is spot on with the training and atmosphere the military provides. I love how difficult this game is, and I love all of the different features the game provides. It is NOT easy to hit a target with an assault rifle from 300 yards in real life, and this game seems to match that same difficulty. Fatigue is a real thing and it seriously hinders your accuracy in real life...Arma 3 makes you stop and catch your breath if you run too far or carry too much gear, or you will have a hard time hitting your target. Enemies are not stupid and they have great vision. I was engaged by two enemies from about 200 yards away and they were using bushes for cover as well as 3-5 second rushes when moving. The AI is more advanced than the average taliban are in real life. haha :p Given my love for the military and for videogames, this one is definitely one of my favorites of all time :D"
76561198130981093,107410,True,0.943312287330627441,"I'm not into arma anymore, but as you can probably tell from the amount of hours I've spent paying this game; I've had an incredible time.

Most of the hours clocked into this game have been spent on roleplay servers. They were so fun back in the day..people weren't too serious, and neither too silly. It was very balanced, very fun. Very replayable.

But arma ain't all about roleplay, so let's talk about other things:

I'll start with combat mechanics, obviously - as the game is all about fighting lol. 
The combat is ABSOLUTELY FLIPPING GREAT! You got things like bullet drop which keeps you on your game, and other things such as weapons becoming less effective as the bullet travels mid-air..you also have very aweosme-looking postures which you can adopt; from laying prone, to sitting on your bum, to crouching, leaning side-to-side, and all dat weird jazz.

It's also very realistic in that, you can only take 1-5 shots before you die pending on which weapon is used against you and what kind of protective gear you have equipped. This means that you have to be VERY careful in-game, otherwise you might just get shot in the head and die. Personally, I enjoy such hardcore mechanics.
Another hardcore mechanic is how damage taken is based on where you are hit on your body. So if you've been shot in the head, you're likely to take a hell of a lot of damage, and this is where armour becomes a huge importance; without armour, you are as vulnerable as a mouse surrounded by a horde of cats. I shouldn't even need to stress how much you need armour! You can go light, or heavy - your choice. The amount you wear does affect movement speed though, so do be careful of that. It also affects how badass you look; I generally like to go light so I look like a badass mofo who is totally capable of destroying anyone who crosses my path lol. Not only that, but your appearance can also affect how easily an enemy can spot you. So if you have a huge bag on your back, and lightly coloured clothes- you can be sure people will spot you with ease.

So yeah. Useful information there, I know. But I am most certainly not done! We have to talk about the tanks, and the awesome vehicles that can totally blow ur balls off!

In arma, there are about 20 different ground vehicles, all unique in both appearance and purpose. You have a few anti-vehicle tanks, a few anti-people tanks, and a few artillery and anti-air tanks. Personally, I love the artillery....they're like mini nukes lol. 

You also have APPACHI ATTACK HELICTOPERS! I mean who doesn't like that!? And some awesome looking submarines and attack planes..and boats :):)
AND CARS WITH MOUNTED TURRETS ON!

Yeah, long-story-short -- arma has tons of vehicles, all awesome in both appearance and nature. Very useful for committing mass-genocide on dem pesky capitalist NATO forces....mmmm, satisfactory

Also sorry for not listing their names. I no good wit dat :(:(

Arma also has lots of game modes to choose from, so you're not restricted to just playing one gamemode and getting bored after an hour. I believe I've already listed one already; roleplay. Others include but are not limited to(due to custom game modes etc); TDM, KOH, KTF, PLAYER VS AI(forgot the official classification, sorry), 5v5 COMPETITIVE MATCHES (like that csgo competitive game mode), custom zombie modes, and survival modes. There are also singleplayer game modes which you can host, such as Zeus or custom Addons which allow for various different gameplay experiences; which brings me to my next topic...

There are loads of mods available on the steam workshop! From halo mods, to Star Wars, to enhanced combat system and mechanic mods, xcom mods, and various others which add more vehicles, factions, armour/clothing, more ai, etc...

The settings menus are also vast and fleshed out in arma, so you can rest assured that you'll be able to configure almost anything you want. 
The game also doesn't require a very high-tier computer to function nominaly, so lag shouldn't really be a problem; especially if you tune down the graphics via the settings menus a bit.

This'll be the last topic within this review; multiplayer.
Multiplayer is obviously a huge part of the game, as I've briefly mentioned previously(with the game modes). This game is almost solely multiplayer-based, but singleplayer is a thing and can be fun, so don't feel restricted. This game being focused mainly on multiplayer is obviously good for playing with friends. You can have much fun playing with friends online in this game, much fun indeed. Lag can be a problem though, so make sure you have a decent internet connection and don't be disappointed if you can't play with a friend based half way across the world from you :) but personally I feel the devs have really improved connectibility over the passed years in terms of multiplayer. Id say it's currently at its peak.

Check this game out. It's relatively cheap for its value, so I advise such.

Apologies if I've missed some flavourful features or mechanics. I'll definitely be sure to edit this review if anyone comes in screaming at me about how I didn't include ""this and that and this and that and this and that"" lol.

We're on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back. I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing.

I run, my Autorifleman runs, my Medic runs. But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across.

     Now that I am at almost 730 hours played at the time of this review's initial publication I thought it was time for me to review my favorite game. This is not going to be a typical review where they say something along the lines of ""swam in the air, 79 out of 10 would be break laws of physics again,"" although that has happened to me and it was hilarious. This is going to be an in depth and honest review of Arma 3.

First though, here is some context.

      When Arma 3 first came out in 2013 I was so excited because I had been watching Arma 2 for so long and I was really hyped on the Arma 3 trailers, not that I actually had a good enough computer to play either one of them of course, so I waited until I finally did. I waited for 3 1/2 years watching YouTube videos and wishing that I could have Arma 3, It was sheer torment. All the cool things that people did just made the situation worse: every valiant last stand against zombies that saved the city, every stealth mission that crippled the enemy, and every close air support gun run that saved a convoy that was under threat just made me want Arma 3 more. So, when I finally had a computer that was good enough to play games on it one of the first games that I got was Arma 3.

       Arma 3 was nothing like I had expected it to be, it was better. An entire virtual sandbox for me to do anything I wanted, go anywhere I wanted, and play any way I wanted. It was not like a ""sophisticated Battlefield"" or a ""Call of Duty on steroids"" like I was expecting it to be, or how I was told it was. Arma 3 is just better. Those descriptions don't even remotely do the game justice. The modding support is astounding to say the least, like I said earlier, zombies. The maps are gorgeous, the weapons are wonderfully modeled, and you have a fully customizable character from the face, to the clothes, to the voice. Arma 3 is more than meets the eye, sure it‚Äôs beautiful, but it also has a great deal of depth behind that gorgeous high polygon count tree, and highly reflective water, and I love it to death for it.

       Arma 3 is in some ways the next logical step for somebody who is into the first person shooter genre, you probably don't know what they say about the game but here it is anyway. ""Children play Call of Duty, boys play Battlefield, men play Arma."" I feel like this statement is true, at least on some levels. The Arma series just feels mature to me, and much more refined than Call of Duty or Battlefield as well. They are not games where you can easily be a""Super Duper MACV Recon SOG SEAL Delta Force Green Beret CIA Operator,"" go ""gunz blazin,"" and kill ""all dem dudes over dere."" Although that sometimes works much to my own surprise and amusement. Arma 3 requires at least some modicum of strategy, or my personal favorite, a great big helping of luck to win, or even be good at in some cases, and I think that is good thing, Arma demands that people invest time into.

       Arma 3 has a large amount of multiplayer content that somebody can enjoy, you can play on a life server and rise through the ranks to become whoever you want to be, whether you want to be are a brutal crime lord, or the mayor of the town. The king of the hill servers bring a nice challenge to Arma 3 where you can fight in and against, in a perfect world, a well organized group of players who are trying very diligently to accomplish their objectives in Arma 3's virtual world. I loved Arma so much that I decided to found a unit which can be found here: join.crabsunion.com

The choice really is up to you on what you want to do in the game, and the built in mission maker with the option to add a ""Zeus"" for mission changes on the fly is always a great option. It is fun to play God for a while, and terrorize your friends.

       The singleplayer content of Arma 3 is quite good, I am very much enjoying the new ""Stepping Stone"" campaign, where NATO forces are trying to seize the picturesque island of Malden in an attempt to attain and maintain aerial dominance over the critically important Strait of Gibraltar.The ""Apex Protocol Campaign"" is very well made in my opinion with several missions that make you feel like you really are a ""Super Duper MACV Recon SOG SEAL Delta Force Green Beret CIA Operator."" Another great thing about the Apex Protocol campaign is that it gives you the option of playing it with friends if you so choose, something I wish the other campaigns did as well.

       Many people say that Arma 3 has a steep learning curve and I disagree. You pick up new things very quickly in Arma 3, or at least I do. Arma 3 just has so much to learn that many people think that it is a very difficult game to play when it is not. Almost every time I play Arma 3 I learn something new about the game or how to play it more effectively. It does not matter whether this is some knowledge about how to use Zeus or make mission more effectively, if it is some new tactic for clearing houses, or even if it is a technique on how to get more stable frame rate. Even with my amount of play time, and the amount of videos I have watched on Arma 3, I am still learning new things constantly. I believe that fact alone sets Arma 3 apart from other games.

       Arma 3 is a somewhat underappreciated treasure in the gaming world with endless content and unlimited scenarios to explore and it deserves more publicity than it is getting. I hope that this review was helpful to you and informative as well. Furthermore I hope that it didn‚Äôt bore you to death too much. Anyways, you have a great day now."

76561198057309553,107410,True,0.932174444198608398,"I have owned this game for a number of weeks now and I have been completely hooked. Great game for the more serious war gamer, not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from Call of Duty series which I consider more for the younger gamers anyway.

Arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games, similar to Battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using. You will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10-20 minutes in a single location (sometimes longer, I personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward.

You will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance.

You can not respawn as quickly as you can in CoD if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic.

The graphics are great, the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to.

I recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible (unless doing paintballing or airgunning), and if you do buy the game - I recommend completing the whole VR Tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the Campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game."

August 20th 2019. I was in a Squad of 7 men. I had the duty of a combat life saver. We had to fly oversea's on a Helicopter. I couldn't tell if my pilot was drunk or my dial up internet was making the helicopter do acrobatics but it was intense. About 5 minutes of flying we touch down safely, getting out as my ears immediately explode from my sound mod making the helicopter 5000x louder. It was awesome. We continue down the road for another 200m when a sniper from the treeline blows off one of my boys heads. We all scramble for cover behind the hill. My boy and I had to kill the MMG who were suppressing our men. We take a flank to the left in hopes of gunning this asshole down. Because the AI are fucking superman, me and my boy were immediately spotted and suppressed by sniper fire behind a rock. He gets hit in the chest which caused a velocity wound and other medical wounds. I sew him up like the god I am and we continue down the hill under all sorts of fire. I take a bullet to my arm and leg, making me as slow as a 60 year old asthmatic hippo with 3 legs. I stitch up my wounds and began limping to some more cover. I fix my leg somehow and im mobile again, pushing into the objective we were supposed to take an hour ago. Our NATO squad successfully raided the base. Only 2 men were killed and all CSAT have been eliminated.

Or so we thought.

The man on the radio sounds like his balls dropped off Mount Everest. He tells us CSAT reinforcements will be arriving shortly. I was unprepared with only 3 mags of ammunition and only a few medical bandages and morphine left. After a few minutes of respite, a shot is echoed from the hills and another firefight takes place again. These assholes now have armored cars with .50 guns on them. 4 of our men are killed within seconds. Thankfully i brought AT rockets with me and I take out the armored car. It explodes in a fiery mess, leaving that area scorched. My boy and I take cover behind a shitty jeep as more and more bullets fly over our heads. He gets hit in the chest 2 times and in the leg 3. I'm out of ammunition in both weapons and I am forced to drag him behind a tree. I take a hit to my chest and start to bleed out. Medical supplies are running thin. 

A few minutes passed and the CSAT have stopped firing. They probably thought we all died. I failed to medic my friend as his cold, dead body lay in the grass. I scavenge off my dead teammates for ammo, leaving my aim in the garbage due to the multiple wounds to the arms. Just when I thought all was over, a NATO chopper has came to evacuate me. I have a blood pressure of the exact definition of trash, my heart rate is 50 and my screen is black and white. I'm limping up a hill while taking multiple shots from the CSAT hiding in the thick brush. I am able to get into the chopper and escape as the last man in my squad to live. 

From that day on, I have diagnosed myself with PTSD. Only play if your balls are made of titanium."

76561198123083438,107410,True,0.926028549671173096,"For this review I'm going to open with a price breakdown, because at the end of the day when you're looking at getting a game you're trying to figure out whether or not it's worth it.

[h1]Price Breakdown[/h1]
Full price of the game and all DLC without deals or bundles $200.25

With my 4,000 hours of gameplay that equates to
 $0.0502375 an hour of playtime (Or about 5 cents)
 $1.2057 a day of playtime

Days between 1 August 2016 (When I bought it) and 12 March 2020 (date of this review)
That's 1,319 days or 31,656 hours
 $0.00632581501137225170583775587566‚Ä¨ an hour (or about half a cent)
 $0.15181956027293404094010614101592 a day (Or about 15 cents)


Arma is a near future military sandbox experience that gives players access to play how they want, whether they want to be infantry, tank operators, war journalists, helicopter pilots, jet pilots, boat captains, divers. Arma has something to suit any players wants.

[h1]Are the DLCs worth it?[/h1]
So when we're looking at value it is well worth it. I often run into people going on in lobbies about how Arma is always bringing out DLCs that cost way too much for what they are and that Bohemia is just a moneyhungering company, but when you break it down the level of detail they bring to the table and the time you spend on the content is unparalleled in terms of replayability. Aside from the singleplayer campaigns and the maps introduced in DLCs all of the content is actually free to use whether you own the DLC or not, the only downside is that if you do use something that you don't own the DLC for then a watermark will show up on the side of your screen for a few seconds every five to ten minutes or so.

It seems that in many peoples eyes the most cardinal sins are the Contact DLC and Laws of War DLC. But I only ever hear complaints about them from people that when I get into debates with them they say 'Oh, I forgot Arma had a singleplayer."" or ""Pfffft, no one plays the singleplayer."" But this last statement couldn't be more wrong. In fact in terms of parts of this game that shine, the singleplayer campaigns and missions are a big part of that.

[h1]Singleplayer[/h1]
The way the tutorial seemlessly blends into the story of the larger campaign, to the political turmoil you find yourself being embroiled in, to the intrigue of the moral dilemmas you find yourself asking at the end of the Laws of War campaign. These stories are memorable! If you ever dip your hands in the Zeus gamemode (the veritable Dungeons and Dragons of the Armaverse) you'll often find yourself recreating some of those memorable experiences for other players, such as the uneasy downtime and that suspenseful few moments before a major gunfight.

[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]
If singleplayer isn't your thing then the multiplayer will keep you coming back again and again, whether you want to have a PVP killfest in King of the Hill, a PVE mission based gamemode in Invade and Annex or Antistasi, the aforementioned Zeus gamemode, a roleplay experience in ArmaLife servers, or a hardcore military simulation. Arma has it all. When it comes to the multiplayer, most of my most enjoyable moments have been the downtime in between missions, whether chilling at the base or traveling to the area of operations. Arma multiplayer is a social experience at heart and that's where the multiplayer experience really shines in my eyes. I have met many people over the years that I am still good friends with to this day, and I have Arma to thank for that. We have had good times together and even better stories to tell. When I was first playing this game I didn't have a microphone so I had to type everything I wanted to get across, because of that I inadvertently learnt touch typing, which is pretty strange to say when someone asks you how you learnt to touch type. The official servers can become quite chaotic, but if you find a nice server a community is hosting then that can be like a second home, even with some of the chaotic people in the official servers the community as a whole is the most welcoming community I've come across in a game.

[h1]Community[/h1]
Touching on the community, Arma has a strong and committed modding and content creation community, mainly due to the passion of the users and the easy to use modding and mission creation tools, such as the 3DEN editor, a 3d mission maker contained within the game itself which harkens back to the golden age of Real Time Strategy games, such as Age of Empires. So if what you want to do isn't quite in the game, you're sure to find a mod or a mission that allows you to do that and if you can't there is an abundance of information on how to make it yourself. And with the easeability of sharing modlists, it's easy to bundle all of the mods you need to make the experience you want to play and then share the list with your mates so that you can all play together.

[h1]Is Arma The Game For You?[/h1]
All in all there is a lot of downtime in this game, so if you're all about instant gratification, killstreaks and being the best of the best then this game probably isn't for you. Arma is a team game and a lot of the game is spent walking, travelling or planning which gives you a lot of time to get to know your team. So if you're not into that then this might not be the game for you when it comes to the multiplayer. If you're looking for a game that is a million different games however, Arma is for you. Because every experience is different and with mods it can even be an entirely different game, for an example just look at DayZ or PlayersUnknownBattlegrounds which both started their lives as mods on Arma.

Arma 3, best 4,000 I've spent in a game ever."
76561198097852352,107410,True,0.925913095474243164,"After putting in over 3500 hours, I have seen the good, the bad, and the downright ugly that ARMA III has to offer. With that being said, I offer my review. It will be a bit long, but after this much time in game, there is a lot to discuss. 

First off, the campaign for single player is ok, but not great. You will be able to find other games with better campaign story modes than ARMA III as the main focus is put on the Multiplayer aspect. However, the campaign and story does prove challenging and the story is solid enough to keep you entertained and engaged. 

Secondly, The DLC content is hit or miss. 

GOOD DLC!
-Tanks add several new tanks into the game and make putting a AP round through your enemy a joy!
-Jets add several new jets to wreak havoc with! It also adds a aircraft carrier!
-Marksman adds some of the best sniper rifles in the game period! Also adds several ghillie suits and scopes. 

Decent DLC.
-Helicopters adds two helis to the game. Mostly for heavy lifting. 
-APEX adds an Island called Tanoa. A dozen weapons and gear. A few vehicles and a few VTOL aircraft. 

Bad DLC!
-Karts. Go-karts on a battlefield. Is this a joke?
-Laws of War. A single player mini campaign for a multiplayer focused game.  Not worth your money.
- Tac-Ops. Again, another single player mini campaign in a multiplayer focused game. Not worth your money.

Third on the list in multiplayer. The true fun to be had with ARMA III is through the multiplayer. There are 1000's of servers all with different options to chose from fitting nearly every type and style of game play. Zombies, they got it. Not into Zombies? No problem. Co-op, yep! Role play, check! Survival, you bet! PvP for those that like to kill others and PvE for the more casual crowd can be found.

Fourth. The community of players found in ARMA III are some of the best I have seen. They are often found to be helpful and willing to lend a hand to newer players and also to veterans in need of assistance. With that being said, you will however run into the occasional troublemaker, rule breaker, or very rarely a hacker. Most of them are dealt with swiftly by the server admins. Then, also,  there is those few players who have little time to read the server rules and blindly run off into the battlefield annoying players by doing things they shouldn't. When corrected by others, they will usually reply "" I didn't know the rules. "" A word of advice. When entering a server, read the rules or simply ask in chat and other players will usually be happy to explain them. 

Fifth, the graphics. For a game that is over 5 years old, the graphics are good. Not great mind you, but good to say the least. 

Sixth, the game play. ARMA III focuses on two things. Realistic militarised game play and multiplayer action via servers. Most of the servers run mods created by people like you and me. Some are about survival and will have you scrounging the map for supplies and gear. Some are about playing team death-match. Some are co-op missions. They can be very fun and can add a lot of vehicles, maps, gear, aircraft, weapons, scenarios, and more to the game. However, no one is prefect and you will find yourself dead periodically after simply opening a door, walking down stairs, entering a vehicle, exiting a vehicle, etc. The point is, expect the unexpected. While this does not happen all the time, you most definitely will encounter a few bugs and glitches from time to time. The most common and frustrating is the sudden vanishing of vehicles left at your base. ARMA loves to eat vehicles for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Also, it will eat your gear, weapons, base, and well....pretty much anything.  So don't get too attached to your stuff. As a server admin for several different servers, I have spent entire days replacing lost items. However, do not expect all admins to be as accommodating as losing items in ARMA is all part of the game.

In all, ARMA III can be a very fun game to play. It's strength comes from the almost limitless ways the game can be played on the 1000's of available servers. After all this time, I still find myself spending the weekends running missions on several servers. In the end, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes realistic military style games."

311 days ago i was Developer banned from Arma 3. The day before i received this ban i had decided to download arma after months away from it. I downloaded the game, it remembered all my mods, downloaded them then i fired the game up.

Do you lads feel out of sorts some times and you sit looking at you vast steam library wondering what to play. Its kinda like choosing a film on Netflix, before you know it times up and you cant be bothered. It was like that. I sat in the in game menu for one minute (screen shot to prove it) before deciding not to play. I exited the game, steam and shut down my PC. 

The following day i decided i was going to fully get back into it. I loaded up my computer. Steam automatically opened but this time with a message. You have been banned from the following games (ARMA 3).

It stated i was banned by the developer. I immediately thought why the hell was i banned. I contacted BI within ten minutes. The response was the same as it remains today. 'we do not deal with bans, battleye do. Please contact battleye if you need support with a ban.' 

BUT YOU DO DEAL WITH BANS - THIS IS A DEV BAN NOT A BE BAN????

I spent the last 10 months contacting BE who eventually responded to tell me that they did not ban me nor did they find anything on my PC that was suspicious to them at the time of my ban. They informed my my logs were 'spotless'

I swung my attention back around to BI. I contacted them the other day. A chap called Dominik responded saying the ban was a battleye ban not a DEV ban.  I have since sent him images of my ban stating it was a DEV ban, steams explanation of a DEV BAN which states a developer informs valve of an account that is suspicious and valve ban them. I have sent images of my conversation with BE and proof that in the two weeks before my ban i had one minute of game time which was spent in the menu. 

The emails have fallen of deaf ears.....No response from Dominik. 

I am absolutely heart broken that from the past 10 months i have been unable to play with my friends and it looks like this situation is not going to change. I am disgusted as the lack of acknowledgement and willingness to support and resolve this from BI. 

I have so many fond memories in Arma 2, OH & 3 but it looks like this is the end of the road for me. I will miss the random chats in game, the communities i was part of and the battles of the field.

76561198061912275,107410,True,0.910561800003051758,"Arma 3 is like that long-term girlfriend/boyfriend you date where, at the honeymoon phase, you are smitten and are like ""wow, this is a 10/10 unique experience."" However, as the months turn to years and time rolls on, you start to realize there are shinier, prettier experiences out there- better looks, sexier moves, more stable, but you stick with it. You realize you're really with a solid 7/10, but **** is it fun. There are things he/she can do that no one else can, and well, despite deviations time to time to fantasize about other experiences, and several on-again/off-again times spent dabbling in those fantasies, you find yourself coming back to him/her. You find yourself truly happy...even after the worst (and unstable) times. Come to think of it, maybe this isn't a healthy relationship, but at the end of the day, it's a **** fun one.

Arma is an unstable, buggy ride and a bit overwhelming on first impressions, but it's an experience that you don't get in any other sandbox game or military shooter. The community is really what drives this game. It's a quasi-sim/quasi-arcade experience that can be tailored to the community/user's need given a little time spent learning how it all works. The developers do a decent job of providing documentation to understand how content creation and mission editing functions, and the community fills (and exceeds) the areas unfulfilled and self-imagined. There are few communities as diverse and robust as Arma's. In one night's events, you can go from playing a modern-day military sim night with your homies, to WWII, Vietnam, then Star Wars, Halo, Starship Troopers, Aliens, to the bloody revolutionary war and more. In short, Arma should be judged more as a sandbox & framework for community addons than a game on its own, and one that over the last 6 years developed into being highly accessible to the average user without even needing to touch a text editor or understand how it works to get custom games going through its implementation of a ""Dungeon Master"" style mission builder called ""Zeus."" Arma's experience varies greatly depending on your level of tolerance for troubleshooting and patience with searching/installing addons. 

This is best experienced by being dragged in by a community of friends... really it's kind of Stockholm Syndrome that kept me in it to start, and the incredible, fun, sometimes frustrating, and hilarious experiences made along the way is something no other game has offered and keeps me coming back. Give it a go, or watch some communities stream their experiences and see for yourself."

76561197979139992,107410,True,0.908434510231018066,"Well after playing this game for a few hours I thought it was about time to write a review.

I struggle to think of many games past or present that manage to do what Arma 3 does. Before the impending praise I'm about to give this game I will say 2 things. 

First, there will be bugs. Not the Starship Troopers kind... Well actually you can kill bugs as a Starship Trooper but I'm talking glitches, rubber banding, inventory issues, layer upon layer of mods causing compatibility issues and the list goes on. You simply have to embrace these problems and make them part of the enemy which you have to overcome! If you are easily put off by the above, Arma isnt for you, in fact the way games are pushed out these days a don't think many games would be for you.

Second, so far I have spent ¬£150 on this game (not including money spent on my own private server endeavours and donations to other public server communities) which sounds and is slightly ridiculous HOWEVER I have spent over 6000 hours on this game which is more than the rest of my steam library combined so as a time spent versus money paid its the cheapest game I've ever bought. All I say to anyone who somehow doesn't own it yet is wait for a Steam super sale and buy everything in one nice discount and your laughing!

The above remain the only 2 reasons I would not recommend this game, price Inc all dlc and the constant battle with bugs etc. All that aside Arma 3 is simply one of the best things you can buy for your PC. From the seemingly infinite Steam Workshop content to the fact that you can do anything from Milsim team based combat to simple PvP to cooperative missions to RPG style game modes to racing mods and a small off shoot you may have heard of called DayZ (Arma 2 mod but ya know what I'm getting at) it really does tick every box. There is a huge learning curve in the form of keybindings. It takes time just finding the right section to rebind keys but once you are comfortable I find the control of your character, chopper, jet, quad bike, humvee, tank, golf caddy etc quite intuitive. No other game gives you as many stances to be in. You can literally find a stance which gives you line of sight through a small hole in a wall at any angle. There are basic and advanced settings for flying so you can feel like a pro or take it easy with simplified physics and controls.

One final word... Community! As with all games you are bound to find trolls and people too competitive to remember what manners are, however on the whole Arma has a great community of players. I play 90% coop missions these days and it is just a breath of fresh air to be playing multiplayer on such a grand scale without this furious and frantic atmosphere which is so prominent in most multilayer games these days. After the demise of the Battlefield franchise after BC2 and BF3 I really needed a game to fill my need for military shooters and Arma 3 came to my rescue.

Rather than go on and on, all I will end on saying is that this game is more like a template for you to then decide what you actually want to spend your time doing. If you are on the fence, browse the workshop and see the sheer amount of 5 star community made content from overhaul mods to subtle quality of life mods. You could spend 6000 hours just playing all the single player campaigns made by other users."

76561198064868476,107410,True,0.905702114105224609,"This is quite possibly the most emotional shooter I've ever played, and it's not because of the campaign. 

Crowd around, children, it's story time.

One day, not so long ago, my squad had just destroyed an anti-air battery. Our pilot landed, and the rest of the squad boarded one by one. I was about to get in when the rockets started flying.

The chopper lifted off, with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes. Unwilling to die before then, I rushed to the nearest cover, a small house by a narrow road. I entered to find a ten year-old player who had also been left behind. He explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his ""clan"".

I politely declined, explaining that my own squad was inbound. As I finished, a Ghost Hawk flew over the horizon. My squad had arrived.

This noble child soldier and I were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting. The sniper screamed as a 6.5 mm cartridge entered his leg. His shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as I climbed in the transport.

My new friend was dead.

10/10, would experience survivor guilt again."

Grossly outdated graphics engine, poorly optimised, it remains the closest game you can ever play to the real thing. During its heyday, milsim communities and modders made this more of an experience than some simple combat simulator - I was able to don exactly the same equipment, uniform and loadouts that I served with while in the army.
NOT worth it if you're playing vanilla arma - terrifying and immersive if you use mods.
You can eat, climb walls, abseil, drink, splint fractures, dress burns, dig foxholes, engage in melee, interrogate, be suppressed and find yourself in a house being breached and cleared by the enemy.
Unless it's vanilla...

76561197971414496,107410,True,0.896043360233306885,"Arma 3 is a tricky game to review, but here‚Äôs me trying it anyway.

The reason why this game is so hard to review lies in the sheer size of the game and the variety of things it may or may not offer for the player.

I take Arma 3 for what it is first and foremost: a platform. What you get is a good looking game with a solid (would be great, but you have to do some optimization to boost your performance) engine, two amazing maps (Stratis and Altis, which is probably the most impressive map I‚Äôve seen in any open world-ish game) and the prospect of near endless new content from the community.

What you don‚Äôt get is an easy to get into mil-shooter with CoD sized maps and a quick pace. If you‚Äôre in for uncomplicated, fast paced PvP gameplay, you should probably look elsewhere. If you‚Äôre sick of that, however, Arma 3 might be just your thing. 

The strength of the Arma series is freedom (**** yeah). You are free to mod the game into almost anything you want, create any type of mission and make your very own gameplay experience. You have to invest some time into the game, but once you got into it, the opportunities are endless.

Want to play huge adversial or coop maps with a hundred players or more?  Arma is just your thing and there are big communities (in many different languages) that will help you find that epic experience.

Want to play singe player? Well, if you expect strong single player content with interesting characters and storyline and so on, then Arma 3 isn‚Äôt the game you‚Äôre looking for.  Or is it? Right now Bohemia delivered one part of a three part campaign ‚Äì those missions are challenging, offer a solid variety of infantry gameplay but don‚Äôt expect a good story or interesting characters. But as mentioned before ‚Äì the huge amount of community made missions and mods offer hours and hours of playtime.

Personally I prefer small cooperative missions to play with friends. Already the steam workshop has countless missions for 2-5 players. 

So, should you buy Arma 3? Well, I‚Äôd certainly recommend it, if any of the things I mentioned above sounds fun to you. It is to say though, that this game is not something that everyone might like, so stay away from it if you are not willing to invest some time into it.

I hope that this review helped some people to decide whether or not they should by Arma 3. Please note that I‚Äôm not a native English speaker, so the language used in this review might seem a little odd for some."

Briefly, I remember that every single second I've played this game is my favorite memory. As I do so, the developer's splash screen flashes on the screen, followed by the warm  welcome of the ARMA III logo and subsequent main menu screen. In this moment, I feel happy and fulfilled. The events of the real world bear no importance to me as I undertake the task of deciding what I'm going to get myself into today. Shall it be Altis life antics? Do I recreate the Osama Bin Laden raid with my friends? Should I attempt to put myself into the shoes of a Marine in the middle of the Tet Offensive of late 1968? My mind wanders into the child-like curiosity and the uncertainty of the events that will take place tonight, and therefore I am excited. This is my conscious mind. My subconscious, however, is aware of one simple, true fact. I am free."

[b] Welcome to Arma 3: The Big One [/b]

If you didn't just start PC gaming an hour ago, you've probably heard of Arma 3. Every time someone says the names Call of Duty, Battlefield, Squad, Red Orchestra, Verdun, or any other shooter title out there, they do so in hushed tones and with their hands over their mouths for fear of the inevitable tongue-lashing they're about to receive from an Arma fan.
Fans of the Arma series are fiercly loyal and totally uncompromising. I have little doubt you've heard the following phrases:

[list]
[*]""If you want [i] realism, [/i] you should play Arma.""
[*]""Only casuals play. . . .""
[*]""Arma 3 is way better because . . . .  and  . . . . ""
[/list]

It's annoying and inarguably elitist but, in their defense, also mostly true. Arma 3 is not for someone who is looking for a casual shooter experience. Arma 3 is for those of us that want to camp out in the trees, waiting for the three guys you saw 30 minutes before, and hoping you can pull of a successful ambush quickly, quietly, and without getting hit. Then, walking for another 30 minutes to link up with another squad, grab some vehicles, and truck a few kilometers out to set up a new FOB. You can expect to go upwards of 3 hours without firing a shot on certain servers.

Which brings me to my next point. . . 

[b] The Game Within a Game Within a Game Within a Game. . . . [/b]

One of A3's major selling points is it's massive, active, dedicated, and diverse community of modders. Arma 3 has a great single player campaign and a few nice King of the Hill and Wasteland servers that you will want to visit occasionally, but Arma gets particularly interesting when you go mod shopping. 

in the mood to lose track of 30 hours while you're dodging police officers and rival gangs as you fight to expand your criminal empire across Altis and/or Tanoa?
Asylum 'Life' servers are a personal favorite of mine. Complete with a living, player-driven economy, impactful politics between gangs and a police force trying to keep control of the island as these gangs throw lead and shade at one another in a constant struggle for turf. If that sounds familiar to you, make no mistake, GTA V doesn't come close to touching the complexity of Life servers.

There are mods for different eras of warfare, gamemodes for about anything you can imagine, and you can find most of them on Steam Workshop, making it easy to access and giving you infinite playtime. You literally cannot run out of things to do because there is [i] always [/i] more content.

I could honestly write about Arma all evening but I'll leave you with a few pros and cons and then I'll wrap things up for you.

[b] PROS: [/b]
[list]
[*]Infinite play value, you can never run out of content
[*]satisfying and memorable moments come to those with patience
[*]game modes for almost everything thanks to the modding community
[*]great graphics for excellent immersion
[*]Endless selection of weapons, vehicles, gear, etc.
[*]Shed your 'casual' title and pick up the mark of 'master' gamer
[/list]

[b] CONS: [/b]
[list]
[*]Arma 3 is not well optimized and is very CPU intensive. Still perfectly playable at 30fps though you will need a high end i7 if you expect to get anywhere near 60fps on most multiplayer servers. AMD users be warned.
[*]Seriously not for casual gamers. I cannot stress this enough. It can take hours to accomplish simple goals depending on your game mode. Highly satisfying when things come together, though.
[*]Expect to move slowly while learning controls. Arma 3 is a game that uses just about [i] all [/i] of your keyboard and it will take you a while to master.

[b] But Should I Buy It? [/b]

I can't recommend this game enough. But if you're a die-hard Call of Duty fan but you still pick up this title, you're in for a rude awakening. Casual gamers be warned."
76561198072447858,107410,True,0.889115750789642334,"What did you do today? I did walk into a stopsign and died in Arma 3.
Meh.. After 3099 hours and 15000 deaths later it's still a game you will return back to.
Thumbsup all the way."
76561198026803446,107410,True,0.888425886631011963,Just buy it. Look at how many hours I have in this game. It's the best money you'll ever spend. It is all things to all gamers.
76561197995591955,107410,True,0.88792949914932251,"Can't tell you if you should buy it or not, but I can tell you this.
You will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isn't there and lack of content if you're not satisfied with what you have. 
But when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, it's something magical you just can't find in any other game.

Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly.
Arma is a game which you can never called finished. There will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations. 

Hope I expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :)

If you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem!

I'll give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, I've used hundreds of hours on Arma 3 that I would never take back.

Now, some people don't care much for the realism, and prefer action-movie esque shooters. That's fine. However, this game shines at gritty realistic firefights.

Once you start progressing from rank to rank you'd never want to stop. This game is amazing, but very addictive to the point where someone like me has 4k hours on it."
76561198049422365,107410,True,0.882125139236450195,"Being an avid ArmA 2 Wasteland/DayZ player back in the day (about 1.5 years ago), I relished the thought of a new ArmA coming out. ArmA 2 was practically uknown until it's popularity was increased by DayZ. I found it interesting to jump into a BI (Bohemia Interactive) title that already had a steady fan-base behind it. Having been about a year since I purchased this game (launch) and over 100 hours of solid gameplay I feel that I can finally write a review that encompasses many of the aspects I have experienced within this game. Now I know what you're thinking: ""$59.99?! This isn't even considered a triple A title! That's like... that's like the price of CoD: Ghosts!"" Now, don't be intimidated by this price, for I can say that off the bat this game is worth a lot more than $59.99. From a value perspective, I found the price to be very reasonable based on the game's content nowadays.

Basically, ArmA is a series of hardcore military simulation; constantly reflecting real-world conditions into a video game. In ArmA 2, I feel that this was it's drawback, for there were certain scenarios where it was realistic to a point of frustration (breaking your leg on a 2 foot fall. It's a game guys, relax). ArmA 3 has found a good balance between an FPS/3rd Person shooter game and realism, making it extremely enjoyable as both a simulator [i] and [/i] a game. I also found that ArmA 3 has very good support for newbies to the series and is able to really engage players into the fun. I imagine it is much easier to get into ArmA 3 than I did ArmA 2 (I can't judge, I'm not new to it). 

The engine is decently optimized and is far less clunkier than the ArmA 2 engine, however rocks are still (and I guess forever will be) broken. Perhaps the game is having difficulty conforming such free player movement with an un-even surface. 

Pro tip: NEVER WALK ON ROCKS UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.

The game also has a variety of content; although players coming over from 2 will notice that there are A LOT less guns. This is partly due to the customization of guns. Instead of having a separate gun for each gun variation (M4A1 HOLO, M4A1 CCO, M4A1) you have a base gun and you are able to add sights, lasers, silencers, flashlights, what have you. However, this is not a full excuse- I feel that there are still a lesser amount of overall GUNS to shoot. Perhaps Bohemia Interactive is trying to fine-tune each gun into the patches as opposed to adding a ton of mediocre weapons simply for variety's sake. What's also very surprisingly good in this game is the Nvidia PhysX that was incorporated. Seeing my transport truck's wheels constantly bumping up and down according to the land under me while I drive troops through the night is oh-so-satisfying as well as, well... realistic! The physics engine has been extremely improved and I quite like it.

I'd like to finally talk about how the guns shoot and how they sound, for this is after all, a big part of the game. Once again I will compare it to ArmA 2, in saying clearly that ArmA 2 featured a more high-pitched ""tappy"" sound when you shot with vertical recoil, while 3 brings a much more deeper, louder shot as well as echo to accompany it as the gun travels backwards into your viewmodel as opposed to upwards. The guns definitely feel better for me, but in the end I'd like to classify this judgment as personal preference.

Lastly, the gamemodes of ArmA 3 are diverse and excellent, my favourite being Wasteland script. I won't go into detail here. There is also King of Hill, DayZ (OF COURSE, but it's MEH) and of course standard operations. Altis Life is also a really sweet one! Check those out if you end up buying.

So yeah, I really like this game and I think that there is so much potential for a growing community. Grab some buddies, hop into Stratis and keep overwatch with some snipers and riflers as you and your team move in through the bushes to grab an objective for more supplies for your squad! Really great game, I'd definitely recommend to any FPS/MILSIM fan! :D"
76561198257508149,107410,True,0.881924927234649658,"Arma 3 taught me that 25 fps is playable.
"
76561197963644421,107410,True,0.881744086742401123,"If you're coming to Arma 3 as an Arma series veteran, you already know what to expect. For the most part, the game hasn't changed since the last installment, but then it's always felt a little bit like Bohemia Interactive are still building on the groundwork laid back in 2001 by Operation Flashpoint, in the world's longest ever game of 'development Buckaroo'. Thankfully, the whole thing has yet to fall to pieces in any significant manner; it's quite happy to continue wobbling uneasily for now.

Arma has a reputation. It's known to be frighteningly obtuse, bewilderingly complex, and often hilariously broken. I can tell you right now that Arma 3 is no different, and absolutely still deserves that reputation. Thankfully, I don't think it's unfair to say that this is the closest an Arma game has come to being 'user friendly'. The controls have been tweaked, and the interface refined a little to accommodate more modern tastes. For these improvements alone, I do recommend it to newcomers to the series over any previous entry.
Coming from any other modern FPS game, it will still take a good few hours of what can feel an awful lot like hard work to get to grips with the controls, but I honestly think Arma 3 will see a far lower 'drop-out rate' of newbies who were frustrated to the point of giving up by the previous games.

At the time of writing, the elephant in the room is the lack of content available. When compared to Arma 2 (which is handsomely bolstered by an array of official expansion packs), the amount of hardware available to play with is frustratingly slim. In many cases, opposing armies are equipped with identical vehicles which get a slightly different paint job at best. For anyone used to the myriad of variants and oddments available in Arma 2, Arma 3 can feel awfully disappointing.
Fortunately, this is alleviated to some extent by the strong mod community. It has long been the case that the best parts of the Arma games are the parts not developed by Bohemia Interactive themselves, and Arma 3 is most definitely continuing this 'tradition'. Nevertheless, I can't help but feel that the game could've done with a few months more time in the oven before full public release.

Speaking of the mod community, I think it's criminal that almost none of the best, near-indispensible mods from Arma 2 have been officially integrated. For a self-professed 'war simulator', Arma 3 is hugely lacking in basic features like being able to rest your weapon on surfaces (even with a visible bipod), or tow damaged vehicles.

For all its flaws, though, Arma 3 is still a blast to play. If you can find a decent group of like-minded gamers with access to a voice-over-net server, you're in for some of the best gaming you'll ever experience. Sure, you'll probably have to load up on mods to satisfy your need for variety. And sure, sometimes the game will crash spectacularly, or the physics engine will flip out and kill you for standing too close to a wall. But when you're standing on a hilltop, looking out over an enemy outpost with your squadmates while a CAS helicopter strafes an enemy APC and spots targets for a distant sniper team; when everything clicks together in the way that only Arma can manage, you'll be glad to have been along for the ride."

76561198019977288,107410,True,0.875654399394989014,"I don't know where to start with this but let's just try:

My first experience with ArmA was with the Operation Flashpoint Series and later on with ArmA 1 (Cold war Assault) and then ArmA 2 (+ all possible Add-Ons).
And i just have to say, that i freakin fell in love with this game (ArmA3) from the very begining.

Sure there were heaves of problems, bugs and shit going wrong at the beginning but i still bought this game as soon as it was availabe (Which should've been like early Alpha or so).

But to explain why i sank over propably 2000 hours of my life into this game:

-Versatility: With the workshop added and all the mod support the game offers, it's just incredible for how long you are able to find new stuff. New Maps, weapons, uniforms, AI-Units, vehicles, helicopers, tanks, etc. etc.

-Versitility: With the ZEUS Modul and the Ed3n Editor you are able to creato soooooo much stuff. You can create YOUR OWN scenarios, and the overview them and change them while playing with zeus. if you play with a few people and you keep changing the missio maker you never ever ever run out of ideas/scenarios to play.

-Versitilititititiy: I think we've bee here before... With the huge mod support theres other beefits aswell. If you are playing onlie you will be able to find all sorts of server. wether you like playing as a lone wolf and kill other players, play in a huge team vs. AI encampments/bases, or just get flipping rich with selling apples. there's something for everyone out there.

But i don't want to hail everythig into the sky here, so here's a few negatives, which imo you should kow before you buy this:

-This game is in NO regards something for people lookig for a run & gun game. It's a Mil Sim after all.
-With the milsim aspect comes the complication of finding key bindings for everything you want to be able to do. so be preapared to learn buttloads of them (Especially with TFAR and ace in play).
-The graphics may look BRILLIANT on a good rig but if you are on minimum specs prepare for some frame problems,
 especially on bigger servers (although i have to say BI optimized a lot with the last few updates)

But other then that i can really just recommend this game if you are into military shooters that own you huge piles of different stuff.

And since my ""N"" key is fucked, here are some Ns for you guys that made it this far: n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n
That should've made up for the missed ones.

76561198030752353,107410,True,0.973724424839019775,"Oh man. Where to even begin with this one. It would be an extreme disservice to simply call Arma 3 a shooter, as it is so, so much more than that. Arma 3 is a military simulator. This is a distinction that it‚Äôs developers hold sacred and are proud of, and one to which I can attest is completely accurate and deserved. But it‚Äôs even more than that. Arma 3 is a gaming platform, upon which so much has already been and will continue to be built for years to come. 

At its core though, Arma 3 in a supremely excellent military sim. The graphics are stunning, the gameplay is excellent, the mechanics are solid, and Bohemia Interactive has done an absolutely amazing job packaging this all together. New comers to the Arma series (as I was) may initially be overwhelmed by the game‚Äôs complex mechanics and decidedly different pace from your typical FPS/shooter. Enemy engagements happen at much greater distance than is typical in the genre and are often brief, brutal, and more times than not will conclude with your demise. There is no handholding here. No mini-maps, no enemy UI icons/indicators, no hit markers, no health bars. If you get shot a couple of times, you will find yourself unceremoniously dispatched. While this creates a high barrier for entry and a steep learning curve for new players, it provides a unique and distinctive play style. Situational awareness, cover, teamwork, suppressive fire, and generally moving purposefully and as if your ass depended on knowing what was behind the next ridge or hiding in the bushes are paramount to your success. Add to these infantry mechanics the amazingly rendered vehicles, armor, helicopters, and planes, each with their own realistic mechanics to learn and master, and you end up with a truly amazing military simulation experience. 

Out of the box, Arma comes with a great single player campaign comprised of 3 separate acts, each containing ~12-15 missions. The campaign focuses on a well crafted story of a military conflict that has erupted over Arma 3‚Äôs two HUGE islands of Stratis and Altis. You play the part of a NATO soldier who finds himself stuck in the middle of a complex engagement. The campaign is rewarding, and challenging. (I have yet to complete it as I‚Äôm stuck on one mission that I simply can‚Äôt seem to complete.)

However the single-player campaign is FAR from the end of this title. The mission editing tools have allowed this amazing community to develop some absolutely awesome single player missions, all of which can be downloaded free of charge from the Steam workshop and numerous other sites around the interwebs. I would also recommend you check out the supremely excellent full game conversion single player mods Whole Lotta Altis and Dynamic Universal War System which will provide countless additional single player hours and could be completely stand alone titles in themselves.

Oh and the multiplayer, oh god the multiplayer. Wasteland, King of the Hill, Invade and Annex, Battle Royale, Breaking Point, so many Co-Op opportunities, the amazing looking upcoming Epoch (currently in closed Alpha). I‚Äôm sure there are so many others that I haven‚Äôt even discovered yet. Each of these represent COMPLETELY USER GENERATED and totally disparate ways to play Multiplayer within the Arma 3 platform. By purchasing Arma 3, you immediately have access to each of these completely gratis and each could essentially be considered totally separate game.

In wrapping up this lengthy review, Arma 3 is an amazing experience and a true accomplishment in game development. It is the only game in recent memory that I can say with confidence that I never get bored with playing. Bohemia Interactive has made it clear that they plan to support this game for years to come, and they have built something amazing on which the possibilities are truly endless.

76561198031889408,107410,True,0.958130419254302979,"Been playing ARMA for almost 10 years now. It‚Äôs grown alongside me, and has created some of the most memorable moments I‚Äôve ever experienced in a videogame. It‚Äôs one of those games which, when it finally ‚Äòclicks‚Äô with you, never quite leaves you. You always find yourself going back to it. It‚Äôs not a game which necessarily empowers you like DOOM or Wolfenstein, but the pay-off from successfully pulling off that mission, that flank, that firing solution, that landing, even that single shot, is unparalleled. 

I‚Äôll always remember the moody fog of the APEX Protocol co-op missions as me and my friend crawled through the jungle, silently taking out patrols hunting for us with flashlights dancing in the dark. I‚Äôll always remember finally Escaping from Tanoa after six hours with my mates ‚Äî it felt like a hiking trip by the end. I‚Äôll always remember staying prone in a ghillie suit as a whole platoon of Russians patrolled past my squad, just like in All Ghillied Up. No other game can recreate the thrill or complexity of these memories in an emergent and inherently personal manner. 

My friends and I, after ten years, have talked for hours about that one mission which went so wrong or that incredible shot one of us made across a whole valley, or just how much we associate some terrains like Sahrani or Stratis with our first years as teenagers back at school. ARMA, for me, is an experience equal in its thrills and frustrations as it is in its nostalgia ‚Äî you come to learn these towns, these fields, these roads and valleys and recall them each as affectionately as the other. Sure, things go wrong: a miscommunication is made, a helicopter crashes, the physics engine freaks out, or the server messes up, but most of the time, you‚Äôll laugh through it. 

ARMA is unlike any other game ‚Äî any other experience. I think this ramble has been quite open in displaying just how much it means to me, and how much it will continue to mean to me. I can assure you, if you give it a chance, it will quickly mean as much to you too."

[h1]*I recommend this particularly for its multiplayer.[/h1]

+ Extremely mod friendly; enjoys full support from the Steam Workshop
+ Visuals & environmental design, save for a few issues here and there (i.e. empty buildings), has largely aged well & looks fantastic
+ Employs a deeply challenging level of realism
+ Multiplayer is still very active; boasts a wonderful variety of gameplay & modded servers to choose from
+ Long, content-packed single player campaign; player choices do affect potential endings, as there are several
+ Time control is back from Arma 2; player can speed up the passage of time, which helps SIGNIFICANTLY to combat the monotony of walking/running very long distances between objectives
+ Enormous map/playable area
+ User-created scenarios & a very easy-to-use scenario creator
+ Boasts incredibly varied gameplay mechanics; from piloting/driving myriad vehicles & gunships, to underwater missions, & everything in-between
+ Map & squad mechanics are back; while they may feel clunky to use in a combat scenario, a little practice goes a long way & serves to open up a slew of options on the battlefield

- Sound design is very hit & miss; some weapons sound identical to others, & vehicle sound effects tend to sound strangely muted
- Dialogue is also hit & miss; while I found the voice-acting to be done largely well, some of the dialogue is a bit awful
- Soundtrack often felt cheesy or inappropriate
- Mission pacing often feels very uneven; I felt that it often leaned too far into the realm of the tedious in the interest of realism (shouldn't be a bad thing in theory, but for the pruposes of a video game, it can put players to sleep in some missions)
- The initial learning curve is considerable, & the tutorial felt inadequate overall; mechanics are amazing on paper, but take an inordinate amount of time to master

Having done both military service and picked up MILSIM airsoft as a hobby this game is the closest you will get to what goes on in reality. There are experiences you will have in ARMA 3 that can not be had in COD or BF, experiences that will have you shaking from the adrenaline release.

One that comes to mind was a mission to destroy an enemy comms tower, I was squad leader of 8 or so AI:s.

As we approached the Comms tower and I told my men to go stealth, no firing unless fired upon. We moved slowly taking advantage of terrain, keeping an watchful eye for enemy patrols. Once the tower was in visual range pace slowed even more and I spent the better part of 30 minutes just looking for enemy patrols and advancing to about 200 meters from the tower.

There I positioned my men to cover a wide firing arc as I had spotted quite a few patrols moving in and about the tower. I considered opening fire and probably being able to drop a good portion of the enemy before they could zero in on our position. But a firefight is always a risk, and these AI had been around for a few missions and I had started to anthropomorphize them a bit and secondly I might get hit and killed.

As I considered how I would start the engagement a sudden hole opened up in the patrol pattern, I realised the tower is unguarded and I had an opportunity to do something I had not considered. I got up and ran as fast as I could towards the tower, all the time expecting the bullets to start cracking above my head. I kept scanning as I ran whizzling through bushes trying to pick a path that the least visibility to any patrols. After what seemed like far too long I reached the tower and threw out a satchel charge and another for good measure, if one would not bring the tower down it would sure attract attention. I turned around and made my way back, as I closed on my men I started ordering them to fall back, hope growing that I might get out of this alive.

Falling back to about 400 meters I finally detonated the satchel charges and the tower fell, from there it was just a short run to the truck and back to Command. I had done it. I had pulled off the perfect mission, not a shot fired and all under my command back alive.

That is what this game is about."

What Im trying to say is: ARMA is not a game, simulation or the answer to the question: How can I commit a war crimes but not be punished for it. Its the friends we made a long the way to commit those war crimes, every flipped convoy that ruins the operation 15 minutes from starting, its the AI shooting your though 30 layers of foliage, its the enemy artillery firing once but the shell exploding 6  times over a 3km radius, every new guy throwing a grenade under your feet while you play dress up in the arsenal, laughing your ass off as your Zeus tries to spice things up with roll playing, crying as Zeus retaliates for killing his roll play doll for ""lols"", every insane AT shot made by one of your guys, every terribly fired RPG you did, its every time the AI some how flanked you and every time you fight your way though it.

76561198007471493,107410,True,0.94609987735748291,"Where do I start with Arma 3...

 1st of all, have I played enough of this game? No, not in the slightest. My total playtime (see above) is pathetic in comparison to those around me. I see upwards of 2000, 3000, 4000 hours just looking at the reviews currently. At the time of writing this review, I sit on a measly 61 hours of gameplay, so I am in no way an expert of this game. 

 What I CAN  tell you is that there are moments in that 61 hours of gameplay that I will probably never forget. This game makes you feel things you won't feel in any other shooter. Call of Duty thrives on high adrenaline, rapid paced combat. Battlefield slows it down a bit, but maintains a good balance of action and spacing between engagements. 

 Arma 3 is a completely different ballpark. There is a LOT of spacing between engagements, which adds massive suspense and makes every firefight very, very meaningful. When combat initiates, there is definately adrenaline pumping action, but it's not fast. Combat is very slow, almost methodical (just like real life) but very, very... awesome. Some things that you'll see in an Arma firefight that you will not see anywhere else:
 - Engagements will be very long distance, often hundreds of meters away, especially if you're roaming the hills or open wilderness. Enemies may only be a fleck in your scope, on another hill entirely, several football fields away from you.
 - You often won't know where you're getting shot from if you're taken by surprise. You don't get any indicators that say ""Hey! someone to your left just shot you!"". Instead, you'll be forced to take cover and locate the enemy the old fashioned way: watching and listening.
 - If you get shot, you probably wont have time to react. One or two shots will kill you without much warning.
 - Teamplay is CRUCIAL. Medics, Anti-Tank, Heavy Gunners all have a part to play in their teams success. 
 - Communication on a whole other level. There is a radio/audio system in the game that is essential to a squad's success. Squad leaders will be vocal, squadees must be willing to take orders and communicate with their superioirs. Directions will not be called out like ""LEFT! RIGHT!"" but rather with compass bearings such as ""There's at least 3 of them at... 248""
 - Stand/Crouch/Prone is also at another level entirely. You can also hunch over, stand up super tall, sit down, lean on your side, bend your body left and right etc.. Manipulating these stances and using them to show as little of you as possible may be a key factor on whether you live or die
 - Every move you make has a pro and a con attached to it. Fire your weapon? Might kill someone, but you might also give your position away or get shot as you peak out of cover. Forget to look left? Arma teaches that wherever you don't look, there will be something that kills you.
 - NO HITMARKERS. You have to make your own call as to whether or not the guy you just shot is dead. If you make the wrong call, your squad may advance only for one of them to be shot by a (very much alive) enemy solider
 - Tanks and armored vehicles are terrifying. It's not like Battlefield where a tank shows up, everybody continues their daily routines and hopefully somebody with anti tank weaponry deals with the 15 ton chunk of metal. Armored vehicles are terrifyingly powerful with weapons foot soldiers can only dream of. A whole squad of 20 people will immediately hit the deck if one of them shpws up, hoping that their AT guys can do the job because...
  - You don't respawn back into the heat of battle. You reaspawn in a base in the middle of nowhere and you either have to take a helicopter to meet with your squad, or ""HALO jump"", which teleports you to an exaxct location but 6000 feet up in the sky, forcing you to have to use your parachute to land safely. HALO jumping back into combat is suicide. Big shiny glorified baloons make really, really good target practice. That also means...
  - If you lose that aforementioned anti-tank guy, you're hooped unless someone takes the risk and picks the launcher off his dead body. That is, unless the tank/armored car blows him up before he gets there. Then 20 people are stranded with very little to do, which means...
 - Every life counts.

 The combat is unreal. I remember we had to clear this city of enemies, entirely. It took us upwards of an hour, but  we checked every single building, room by room, until, In the center plaza, there he stood; the last man we had to kill. All the other building were checked, and I saw a head poking out behind this obstacle in the dead center of the city,

 ""I found him!"" I yell over the squad's radio, ""Central Garden, straight north"" I notice he pokes his head around the corner. My assault rifle was depleted.

 I knew I should have packed more flipping ammo.
 
 So I pull out my pistol. Fire, miss, fire, miss, rinse andrepeat. I empty my whole clip and the man is not dead. So I reload, and just start Terminator walking my way towards this guy. Firing every round I have. The guy doesn't poke his head out anymore. One clip exhausted, then another. And another. This guy will not die. I least I'm supressing him. 

 Then he pops around, shoots me once. Dead.

 My squad catches up ""What the hell was all that shooting?!"" the commander expresses.
 
 They grenade him. Dead.

 Wish I'd have thought of that sooner. 

 The medic gives me a nice repair. I borrow some mags off of him. We get on the chopper, talking about how wicked that mission was. We get a new one, something about planting a bomb somewhere.

 At this point the squad has bonded. We knew eachothers names, at least. We just kept talking, getting closer to the LZ, mocking the pilot for driving too low to the ground. We land and immediately, the chopper comes under fire.

 ""RUN! SPREAD OUT!""

 The heli blows up before it can leave. We all die in a blaze of glory.

 And I left the game after that.

Enemies are not stupid and they have great vision. I was engaged by two enemies from about 200 yards away and they were using bushes for cover as well as 3-5 second rushes when moving. The AI is more advanced than the average taliban are in real life. haha :p Given my love for the military and for videogames, this one is definitely one of my favorites of all time :D"
76561198130981093,107410,True,0.943312287330627441,"I'm not into arma anymore, but as you can probably tell from the amount of hours I've spent paying this game; I've had an incredible time.

Most of the hours clocked into this game have been spent on roleplay servers. They were so fun back in the day..people weren't too serious, and neither too silly. It was very balanced, very fun. Very replayable.

But arma ain't all about roleplay, so let's talk about other things:

I'll start with combat mechanics, obviously - as the game is all about fighting lol. 
The combat is ABSOLUTELY FLIPPING GREAT! You got things like bullet drop which keeps you on your game, and other things such as weapons becoming less effective as the bullet travels mid-air..you also have very aweosme-looking postures which you can adopt; from laying prone, to sitting on your bum, to crouching, leaning side-to-side, and all dat weird jazz.

It's also very realistic in that, you can only take 1-5 shots before you die pending on which weapon is used against you and what kind of protective gear you have equipped. This means that you have to be VERY careful in-game, otherwise you might just get shot in the head and die. Personally, I enjoy such hardcore mechanics.
Another hardcore mechanic is how damage taken is based on where you are hit on your body. So if you've been shot in the head, you're likely to take a hell of a lot of damage, and this is where armour becomes a huge importance; without armour, you are as vulnerable as a mouse surrounded by a horde of cats. I shouldn't even need to stress how much you need armour! You can go light, or heavy - your choice. The amount you wear does affect movement speed though, so do be careful of that. It also affects how badass you look; I generally like to go light so I look like a badass mofo who is totally capable of destroying anyone who crosses my path lol. Not only that, but your appearance can also affect how easily an enemy can spot you. So if you have a huge bag on your back, and lightly coloured clothes- you can be sure people will spot you with ease.

So yeah. Useful information there, I know. But I am most certainly not done! We have to talk about the tanks, and the awesome vehicles that can totally blow ur balls off!

In arma, there are about 20 different ground vehicles, all unique in both appearance and purpose. You have a few anti-vehicle tanks, a few anti-people tanks, and a few artillery and anti-air tanks. Personally, I love the artillery....they're like mini nukes lol. 

You also have APPACHI ATTACK HELICTOPERS! I mean who doesn't like that!? And some awesome looking submarines and attack planes..and boats :):)
AND CARS WITH MOUNTED TURRETS ON!

Yeah, long-story-short -- arma has tons of vehicles, all awesome in both appearance and nature. Very useful for committing mass-genocide on dem pesky capitalist NATO forces....mmmm, satisfactory

Also sorry for not listing their names. I no good wit dat :(:(

Arma also has lots of game modes to choose from, so you're not restricted to just playing one gamemode and getting bored after an hour. I believe I've already listed one already; roleplay. Others include but are not limited to(due to custom game modes etc); TDM, KOH, KTF, PLAYER VS AI(forgot the official classification, sorry), 5v5 COMPETITIVE MATCHES (like that csgo competitive game mode), custom zombie modes, and survival modes. There are also singleplayer game modes which you can host, such as Zeus or custom Addons which allow for various different gameplay experiences; which brings me to my next topic...

There are loads of mods available on the steam workshop! From halo mods, to Star Wars, to enhanced combat system and mechanic mods, xcom mods, and various others which add more vehicles, factions, armour/clothing, more ai, etc...

The settings menus are also vast and fleshed out in arma, so you can rest assured that you'll be able to configure almost anything you want. 
The game also doesn't require a very high-tier computer to function nominaly, so lag shouldn't really be a problem; especially if you tune down the graphics via the settings menus a bit.

This'll be the last topic within this review; multiplayer.
Multiplayer is obviously a huge part of the game, as I've briefly mentioned previously(with the game modes). This game is almost solely multiplayer-based, but singleplayer is a thing and can be fun, so don't feel restricted. This game being focused mainly on multiplayer is obviously good for playing with friends. You can have much fun playing with friends online in this game, much fun indeed. Lag can be a problem though, so make sure you have a decent internet connection and don't be disappointed if you can't play with a friend based half way across the world from you :) but personally I feel the devs have really improved connectibility over the passed years in terms of multiplayer. Id say it's currently at its peak.

Check this game out. It's relatively cheap for its value, so I advise such.

Apologies if I've missed some flavourful features or mechanics. I'll definitely be sure to edit this review if anyone comes in screaming at me about how I didn't include ""this and that and this and that and this and that"" lol.

We're on our way to the objective, a small dump east of a town occupied by enemy forces. I'm leading a team of 4 men. We come to a crossroad and I sprint across, telling my men to hold back. I cross a few more times, trying to get a response from any snipers. Nothing.

I run, my Autorifleman runs, my Medic runs. But I kept my Marksman on the other side to make sure we'd make it across.

Anybody seen Full Metal Jacket all the way through? Remember the sniper scene?

The marksman takes a round in the leg as we're running and goes down. He then takes two more in the chest. The kid who was playing had some mad acting skills, he played it up to 11 here.
He screams as he's being shot. Crawling, drenched in his own blood.
""SARGE? YOU AIN'T LEAVING ME OUT HERE LIKE THIS, RIGHT? I-I WANNA GO WITH YOU GUYS! C'MON SARGE, H-HELP ME! C'MON! PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME!""

     Now that I am at almost 730 hours played at the time of this review's initial publication I thought it was time for me to review my favorite game. This is not going to be a typical review where they say something along the lines of ""swam in the air, 79 out of 10 would be break laws of physics again,"" although that has happened to me and it was hilarious. This is going to be an in depth and honest review of Arma 3.

First though, here is some context.

      When Arma 3 first came out in 2013 I was so excited because I had been watching Arma 2 for so long and I was really hyped on the Arma 3 trailers, not that I actually had a good enough computer to play either one of them of course, so I waited until I finally did. I waited for 3 1/2 years watching YouTube videos and wishing that I could have Arma 3, It was sheer torment. All the cool things that people did just made the situation worse: every valiant last stand against zombies that saved the city, every stealth mission that crippled the enemy, and every close air support gun run that saved a convoy that was under threat just made me want Arma 3 more. So, when I finally had a computer that was good enough to play games on it one of the first games that I got was Arma 3.

       Arma 3 was nothing like I had expected it to be, it was better. An entire virtual sandbox for me to do anything I wanted, go anywhere I wanted, and play any way I wanted. It was not like a ""sophisticated Battlefield"" or a ""Call of Duty on steroids"" like I was expecting it to be, or how I was told it was. Arma 3 is just better. Those descriptions don't even remotely do the game justice. The modding support is astounding to say the least, like I said earlier, zombies. The maps are gorgeous, the weapons are wonderfully modeled, and you have a fully customizable character from the face, to the clothes, to the voice. Arma 3 is more than meets the eye, sure it‚Äôs beautiful, but it also has a great deal of depth behind that gorgeous high polygon count tree, and highly reflective water, and I love it to death for it.

       Arma 3 is in some ways the next logical step for somebody who is into the first person shooter genre, you probably don't know what they say about the game but here it is anyway. ""Children play Call of Duty, boys play Battlefield, men play Arma."" I feel like this statement is true, at least on some levels. The Arma series just feels mature to me, and much more refined than Call of Duty or Battlefield as well. They are not games where you can easily be a""Super Duper MACV Recon SOG SEAL Delta Force Green Beret CIA Operator,"" go ""gunz blazin,"" and kill ""all dem dudes over dere."" Although that sometimes works much to my own surprise and amusement. Arma 3 requires at least some modicum of strategy, or my personal favorite, a great big helping of luck to win, or even be good at in some cases, and I think that is good thing, Arma demands that people invest time into.

       Arma 3 has a large amount of multiplayer content that somebody can enjoy, you can play on a life server and rise through the ranks to become whoever you want to be, whether you want to be are a brutal crime lord, or the mayor of the town. The king of the hill servers bring a nice challenge to Arma 3 where you can fight in and against, in a perfect world, a well organized group of players who are trying very diligently to accomplish their objectives in Arma 3's virtual world. I loved Arma so much that I decided to found a unit which can be found here: join.crabsunion.com

The choice really is up to you on what you want to do in the game, and the built in mission maker with the option to add a ""Zeus"" for mission changes on the fly is always a great option. It is fun to play God for a while, and terrorize your friends.

       The singleplayer content of Arma 3 is quite good, I am very much enjoying the new ""Stepping Stone"" campaign, where NATO forces are trying to seize the picturesque island of Malden in an attempt to attain and maintain aerial dominance over the critically important Strait of Gibraltar.The ""Apex Protocol Campaign"" is very well made in my opinion with several missions that make you feel like you really are a ""Super Duper MACV Recon SOG SEAL Delta Force Green Beret CIA Operator."" Another great thing about the Apex Protocol campaign is that it gives you the option of playing it with friends if you so choose, something I wish the other campaigns did as well.

       Many people say that Arma 3 has a steep learning curve and I disagree. You pick up new things very quickly in Arma 3, or at least I do. Arma 3 just has so much to learn that many people think that it is a very difficult game to play when it is not. Almost every time I play Arma 3 I learn something new about the game or how to play it more effectively. It does not matter whether this is some knowledge about how to use Zeus or make mission more effectively, if it is some new tactic for clearing houses, or even if it is a technique on how to get more stable frame rate. Even with my amount of play time, and the amount of videos I have watched on Arma 3, I am still learning new things constantly. I believe that fact alone sets Arma 3 apart from other games.

       Arma 3 is a somewhat underappreciated treasure in the gaming world with endless content and unlimited scenarios to explore and it deserves more publicity than it is getting. I hope that this review was helpful to you and informative as well. Furthermore I hope that it didn‚Äôt bore you to death too much. Anyways, you have a great day now."

76561198057309553,107410,True,0.932174444198608398,"I have owned this game for a number of weeks now and I have been completely hooked. Great game for the more serious war gamer, not for those who prefer the fast paced combat that you get from Call of Duty series which I consider more for the younger gamers anyway.

Arma 3 moves a lot slower and is more squad based than other war games, similar to Battlefield series only slower than that when playing online and you may find yourself on 10 minute helicopter rides just to get into the battlefield and you will be highly satisfied with each kill you make as you know a single round landed by your enemy could be fatal regardless of the weapon they are using. You will have to make good use of any cover you can find and hit the dirt as soon as you hear a bullet crack over your head and then very carefully survey the surrouding area and work out where you are taking fire from as it will usually not be obvious where the fire is coming from and you will find yourself having to hold up for 10-20 minutes in a single location (sometimes longer, I personally have gotten pinned in one location for over an hour) because you are either pinned by enemy fire or it is too dangerous to move forward.

You will need to buffer up on your mic communication skills as most players use proper phonetics etc when relaying information to each other on the battlefield such as coordinates and other reconaissance.

You can not respawn as quickly as you can in CoD if you are taken down by enemy fire so staying alive is more crucial than any other war game you have played and you wanna hope you are moving up with a squad that has a medic.

The graphics are great, the game is a little glitchy at times and the controls take a little getting used to.

I recommend buying this game to any serious war game enthusiasts who want to get as close to war as possible (unless doing paintballing or airgunning), and if you do buy the game - I recommend completing the whole VR Tutorial before actually joining a server or playing the Campaign as you will need to really learn all those different keys that may make the difference in a hairy situation in game."

August 20th 2019. I was in a Squad of 7 men. I had the duty of a combat life saver. We had to fly oversea's on a Helicopter. I couldn't tell if my pilot was drunk or my dial up internet was making the helicopter do acrobatics but it was intense. About 5 minutes of flying we touch down safely, getting out as my ears immediately explode from my sound mod making the helicopter 5000x louder. It was awesome. We continue down the road for another 200m when a sniper from the treeline blows off one of my boys heads. We all scramble for cover behind the hill. My boy and I had to kill the MMG who were suppressing our men. We take a flank to the left in hopes of gunning this asshole down. Because the AI are fucking superman, me and my boy were immediately spotted and suppressed by sniper fire behind a rock. He gets hit in the chest which caused a velocity wound and other medical wounds. I sew him up like the god I am and we continue down the hill under all sorts of fire. I take a bullet to my arm and leg, making me as slow as a 60 year old asthmatic hippo with 3 legs. I stitch up my wounds and began limping to some more cover. I fix my leg somehow and im mobile again, pushing into the objective we were supposed to take an hour ago. Our NATO squad successfully raided the base. Only 2 men were killed and all CSAT have been eliminated.

Or so we thought.

The man on the radio sounds like his balls dropped off Mount Everest. He tells us CSAT reinforcements will be arriving shortly. I was unprepared with only 3 mags of ammunition and only a few medical bandages and morphine left. After a few minutes of respite, a shot is echoed from the hills and another firefight takes place again. These assholes now have armored cars with .50 guns on them. 4 of our men are killed within seconds. Thankfully i brought AT rockets with me and I take out the armored car. It explodes in a fiery mess, leaving that area scorched. My boy and I take cover behind a shitty jeep as more and more bullets fly over our heads. He gets hit in the chest 2 times and in the leg 3. I'm out of ammunition in both weapons and I am forced to drag him behind a tree. I take a hit to my chest and start to bleed out. Medical supplies are running thin. 

A few minutes passed and the CSAT have stopped firing. They probably thought we all died. I failed to medic my friend as his cold, dead body lay in the grass. I scavenge off my dead teammates for ammo, leaving my aim in the garbage due to the multiple wounds to the arms. Just when I thought all was over, a NATO chopper has came to evacuate me. I have a blood pressure of the exact definition of trash, my heart rate is 50 and my screen is black and white. I'm limping up a hill while taking multiple shots from the CSAT hiding in the thick brush. I am able to get into the chopper and escape as the last man in my squad to live. 

From that day on, I have diagnosed myself with PTSD. Only play if your balls are made of titanium."

76561198123083438,107410,True,0.926028549671173096,"For this review I'm going to open with a price breakdown, because at the end of the day when you're looking at getting a game you're trying to figure out whether or not it's worth it.

[h1]Price Breakdown[/h1]
Full price of the game and all DLC without deals or bundles $200.25

With my 4,000 hours of gameplay that equates to
 $0.0502375 an hour of playtime (Or about 5 cents)
 $1.2057 a day of playtime

 $0.15181956027293404094010614101592 a day (Or about 15 cents)


Arma is a near future military sandbox experience that gives players access to play how they want, whether they want to be infantry, tank operators, war journalists, helicopter pilots, jet pilots, boat captains, divers. Arma has something to suit any players wants.

[h1]Are the DLCs worth it?[/h1]
So when we're looking at value it is well worth it. I often run into people going on in lobbies about how Arma is always bringing out DLCs that cost way too much for what they are and that Bohemia is just a moneyhungering company, but when you break it down the level of detail they bring to the table and the time you spend on the content is unparalleled in terms of replayability. Aside from the singleplayer campaigns and the maps introduced in DLCs all of the content is actually free to use whether you own the DLC or not, the only downside is that if you do use something that you don't own the DLC for then a watermark will show up on the side of your screen for a few seconds every five to ten minutes or so.

It seems that in many peoples eyes the most cardinal sins are the Contact DLC and Laws of War DLC. But I only ever hear complaints about them from people that when I get into debates with them they say 'Oh, I forgot Arma had a singleplayer."" or ""Pfffft, no one plays the singleplayer."" But this last statement couldn't be more wrong. In fact in terms of parts of this game that shine, the singleplayer campaigns and missions are a big part of that.

[h1]Singleplayer[/h1]
The way the tutorial seemlessly blends into the story of the larger campaign, to the political turmoil you find yourself being embroiled in, to the intrigue of the moral dilemmas you find yourself asking at the end of the Laws of War campaign. These stories are memorable! If you ever dip your hands in the Zeus gamemode (the veritable Dungeons and Dragons of the Armaverse) you'll often find yourself recreating some of those memorable experiences for other players, such as the uneasy downtime and that suspenseful few moments before a major gunfight.

[h1]Multiplayer[/h1]
If singleplayer isn't your thing then the multiplayer will keep you coming back again and again, whether you want to have a PVP killfest in King of the Hill, a PVE mission based gamemode in Invade and Annex or Antistasi, the aforementioned Zeus gamemode, a roleplay experience in ArmaLife servers, or a hardcore military simulation. Arma has it all. When it comes to the multiplayer, most of my most enjoyable moments have been the downtime in between missions, whether chilling at the base or traveling to the area of operations. Arma multiplayer is a social experience at heart and that's where the multiplayer experience really shines in my eyes. I have met many people over the years that I am still good friends with to this day, and I have Arma to thank for that. We have had good times together and even better stories to tell. When I was first playing this game I didn't have a microphone so I had to type everything I wanted to get across, because of that I inadvertently learnt touch typing, which is pretty strange to say when someone asks you how you learnt to touch type. The official servers can become quite chaotic, but if you find a nice server a community is hosting then that can be like a second home, even with some of the chaotic people in the official servers the community as a whole is the most welcoming community I've come across in a game.

[h1]Community[/h1]
Touching on the community, Arma has a strong and committed modding and content creation community, mainly due to the passion of the users and the easy to use modding and mission creation tools, such as the 3DEN editor, a 3d mission maker contained within the game itself which harkens back to the golden age of Real Time Strategy games, such as Age of Empires. So if what you want to do isn't quite in the game, you're sure to find a mod or a mission that allows you to do that and if you can't there is an abundance of information on how to make it yourself. And with the easeability of sharing modlists, it's easy to bundle all of the mods you need to make the experience you want to play and then share the list with your mates so that you can all play together.

[h1]Is Arma The Game For You?[/h1]
All in all there is a lot of downtime in this game, so if you're all about instant gratification, killstreaks and being the best of the best then this game probably isn't for you. Arma is a team game and a lot of the game is spent walking, travelling or planning which gives you a lot of time to get to know your team. So if you're not into that then this might not be the game for you when it comes to the multiplayer. If you're looking for a game that is a million different games however, Arma is for you. Because every experience is different and with mods it can even be an entirely different game, for an example just look at DayZ or PlayersUnknownBattlegrounds which both started their lives as mods on Arma.

Arma 3, best 4,000 I've spent in a game ever."
76561198097852352,107410,True,0.925913095474243164,"After putting in over 3500 hours, I have seen the good, the bad, and the downright ugly that ARMA III has to offer. With that being said, I offer my review. It will be a bit long, but after this much time in game, there is a lot to discuss. 

First off, the campaign for single player is ok, but not great. You will be able to find other games with better campaign story modes than ARMA III as the main focus is put on the Multiplayer aspect. However, the campaign and story does prove challenging and the story is solid enough to keep you entertained and engaged. 

Secondly, The DLC content is hit or miss. 

GOOD DLC!
-Tanks add several new tanks into the game and make putting a AP round through your enemy a joy!
-Jets add several new jets to wreak havoc with! It also adds a aircraft carrier!
-Marksman adds some of the best sniper rifles in the game period! Also adds several ghillie suits and scopes. 

Decent DLC.
-Helicopters adds two helis to the game. Mostly for heavy lifting. 
-APEX adds an Island called Tanoa. A dozen weapons and gear. A few vehicles and a few VTOL aircraft. 

Bad DLC!
-Karts. Go-karts on a battlefield. Is this a joke?
-Laws of War. A single player mini campaign for a multiplayer focused game.  Not worth your money.
- Tac-Ops. Again, another single player mini campaign in a multiplayer focused game. Not worth your money.

Third on the list in multiplayer. The true fun to be had with ARMA III is through the multiplayer. There are 1000's of servers all with different options to chose from fitting nearly every type and style of game play. Zombies, they got it. Not into Zombies? No problem. Co-op, yep! Role play, check! Survival, you bet! PvP for those that like to kill others and PvE for the more casual crowd can be found.

Fourth. The community of players found in ARMA III are some of the best I have seen. They are often found to be helpful and willing to lend a hand to newer players and also to veterans in need of assistance. With that being said, you will however run into the occasional troublemaker, rule breaker, or very rarely a hacker. Most of them are dealt with swiftly by the server admins. Then, also,  there is those few players who have little time to read the server rules and blindly run off into the battlefield annoying players by doing things they shouldn't. When corrected by others, they will usually reply "" I didn't know the rules. "" A word of advice. When entering a server, read the rules or simply ask in chat and other players will usually be happy to explain them. 

Fifth, the graphics. For a game that is over 5 years old, the graphics are good. Not great mind you, but good to say the least. 

Sixth, the game play. ARMA III focuses on two things. Realistic militarised game play and multiplayer action via servers. Most of the servers run mods created by people like you and me. Some are about survival and will have you scrounging the map for supplies and gear. Some are about playing team death-match. Some are co-op missions. They can be very fun and can add a lot of vehicles, maps, gear, aircraft, weapons, scenarios, and more to the game. However, no one is prefect and you will find yourself dead periodically after simply opening a door, walking down stairs, entering a vehicle, exiting a vehicle, etc. The point is, expect the unexpected. While this does not happen all the time, you most definitely will encounter a few bugs and glitches from time to time. The most common and frustrating is the sudden vanishing of vehicles left at your base. ARMA loves to eat vehicles for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Also, it will eat your gear, weapons, base, and well....pretty much anything.  So don't get too attached to your stuff. As a server admin for several different servers, I have spent entire days replacing lost items. However, do not expect all admins to be as accommodating as losing items in ARMA is all part of the game.

In all, ARMA III can be a very fun game to play. It's strength comes from the almost limitless ways the game can be played on the 1000's of available servers. After all this time, I still find myself spending the weekends running missions on several servers. In the end, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes realistic military style games."

76561198019130249,107410,False,0.92248910665512085,"Right before i get started - I was a massive fan of the Arma series and have been for 10+ years, it is the reason i bought my first gaming PC.

311 days ago i was Developer banned from Arma 3. The day before i received this ban i had decided to download arma after months away from it. I downloaded the game, it remembered all my mods, downloaded them then i fired the game up.

Do you lads feel out of sorts some times and you sit looking at you vast steam library wondering what to play. Its kinda like choosing a film on Netflix, before you know it times up and you cant be bothered. It was like that. I sat in the in game menu for one minute (screen shot to prove it) before deciding not to play. I exited the game, steam and shut down my PC. 

The following day i decided i was going to fully get back into it. I loaded up my computer. Steam automatically opened but this time with a message. You have been banned from the following games (ARMA 3).

It stated i was banned by the developer. I immediately thought why the hell was i banned. I contacted BI within ten minutes. The response was the same as it remains today. 'we do not deal with bans, battleye do. Please contact battleye if you need support with a ban.' 

BUT YOU DO DEAL WITH BANS - THIS IS A DEV BAN NOT A BE BAN????

I spent the last 10 months contacting BE who eventually responded to tell me that they did not ban me nor did they find anything on my PC that was suspicious to them at the time of my ban. They informed my my logs were 'spotless'

I swung my attention back around to BI. I contacted them the other day. A chap called Dominik responded saying the ban was a battleye ban not a DEV ban.  I have since sent him images of my ban stating it was a DEV ban, steams explanation of a DEV BAN which states a developer informs valve of an account that is suspicious and valve ban them. I have sent images of my conversation with BE and proof that in the two weeks before my ban i had one minute of game time which was spent in the menu. 

The emails have fallen of deaf ears.....No response from Dominik. 

I am absolutely heart broken that from the past 10 months i have been unable to play with my friends and it looks like this situation is not going to change. I am disgusted as the lack of acknowledgement and willingness to support and resolve this from BI. 

I have so many fond memories in Arma 2, OH & 3 but it looks like this is the end of the road for me. I will miss the random chats in game, the communities i was part of and the battles of the field. 

You never know, if you guys blow this up they might just let me back :)"

76561198061912275,107410,True,0.910561800003051758,"Arma 3 is like that long-term girlfriend/boyfriend you date where, at the honeymoon phase, you are smitten and are like ""wow, this is a 10/10 unique experience."" However, as the months turn to years and time rolls on, you start to realize there are shinier, prettier experiences out there- better looks, sexier moves, more stable, but you stick with it. You realize you're really with a solid 7/10, but **** is it fun. There are things he/she can do that no one else can, and well, despite deviations time to time to fantasize about other experiences, and several on-again/off-again times spent dabbling in those fantasies, you find yourself coming back to him/her. You find yourself truly happy...even after the worst (and unstable) times. Come to think of it, maybe this isn't a healthy relationship, but at the end of the day, it's a **** fun one.

Arma is an unstable, buggy ride and a bit overwhelming on first impressions, but it's an experience that you don't get in any other sandbox game or military shooter. The community is really what drives this game. It's a quasi-sim/quasi-arcade experience that can be tailored to the community/user's need given a little time spent learning how it all works. The developers do a decent job of providing documentation to understand how content creation and mission editing functions, and the community fills (and exceeds) the areas unfulfilled and self-imagined. There are few communities as diverse and robust as Arma's. In one night's events, you can go from playing a modern-day military sim night with your homies, to WWII, Vietnam, then Star Wars, Halo, Starship Troopers, Aliens, to the bloody revolutionary war and more. In short, Arma should be judged more as a sandbox & framework for community addons than a game on its own, and one that over the last 6 years developed into being highly accessible to the average user without even needing to touch a text editor or understand how it works to get custom games going through its implementation of a ""Dungeon Master"" style mission builder called ""Zeus."" Arma's experience varies greatly depending on your level of tolerance for troubleshooting and patience with searching/installing addons. 

This is best experienced by being dragged in by a community of friends... really it's kind of Stockholm Syndrome that kept me in it to start, and the incredible, fun, sometimes frustrating, and hilarious experiences made along the way is something no other game has offered and keeps me coming back. Give it a go, or watch some communities stream their experiences and see for yourself."

76561197979139992,107410,True,0.908434510231018066,"Well after playing this game for a few hours I thought it was about time to write a review.

I struggle to think of many games past or present that manage to do what Arma 3 does. Before the impending praise I'm about to give this game I will say 2 things. 

First, there will be bugs. Not the Starship Troopers kind... Well actually you can kill bugs as a Starship Trooper but I'm talking glitches, rubber banding, inventory issues, layer upon layer of mods causing compatibility issues and the list goes on. You simply have to embrace these problems and make them part of the enemy which you have to overcome! If you are easily put off by the above, Arma isnt for you, in fact the way games are pushed out these days a don't think many games would be for you.

Second, so far I have spent ¬£150 on this game (not including money spent on my own private server endeavours and donations to other public server communities) which sounds and is slightly ridiculous HOWEVER I have spent over 6000 hours on this game which is more than the rest of my steam library combined so as a time spent versus money paid its the cheapest game I've ever bought. All I say to anyone who somehow doesn't own it yet is wait for a Steam super sale and buy everything in one nice discount and your laughing!

The above remain the only 2 reasons I would not recommend this game, price Inc all dlc and the constant battle with bugs etc. All that aside Arma 3 is simply one of the best things you can buy for your PC. From the seemingly infinite Steam Workshop content to the fact that you can do anything from Milsim team based combat to simple PvP to cooperative missions to RPG style game modes to racing mods and a small off shoot you may have heard of called DayZ (Arma 2 mod but ya know what I'm getting at) it really does tick every box. There is a huge learning curve in the form of keybindings. It takes time just finding the right section to rebind keys but once you are comfortable I find the control of your character, chopper, jet, quad bike, humvee, tank, golf caddy etc quite intuitive. No other game gives you as many stances to be in. You can literally find a stance which gives you line of sight through a small hole in a wall at any angle. There are basic and advanced settings for flying so you can feel like a pro or take it easy with simplified physics and controls.

One final word... Community! As with all games you are bound to find trolls and people too competitive to remember what manners are, however on the whole Arma has a great community of players. I play 90% coop missions these days and it is just a breath of fresh air to be playing multiplayer on such a grand scale without this furious and frantic atmosphere which is so prominent in most multilayer games these days. After the demise of the Battlefield franchise after BC2 and BF3 I really needed a game to fill my need for military shooters and Arma 3 came to my rescue.

Rather than go on and on, all I will end on saying is that this game is more like a template for you to then decide what you actually want to spend your time doing. If you are on the fence, browse the workshop and see the sheer amount of 5 star community made content from overhaul mods to subtle quality of life mods. You could spend 6000 hours just playing all the single player campaigns made by other users."

Crowd around, children, it's story time.

One day, not so long ago, my squad had just destroyed an anti-air battery. Our pilot landed, and the rest of the squad boarded one by one. I was about to get in when the rockets started flying.

The chopper lifted off, with my pilot saying that he would return in a few minutes. Unwilling to die before then, I rushed to the nearest cover, a small house by a narrow road. I entered to find a ten year-old player who had also been left behind. He explained that he was a sniper and invited me to join his ""clan"".

I politely declined, explaining that my own squad was inbound. As I finished, a Ghost Hawk flew over the horizon. My squad had arrived.

This noble child soldier and I were sprinting to the helicopter when the bullets started hitting. The sniper screamed as a 6.5 mm cartridge entered his leg. His shrieks for help were cut short by one final burst of carbine fire as I climbed in the transport.

My new friend was dead.

Grossly outdated graphics engine, poorly optimised, it remains the closest game you can ever play to the real thing. During its heyday, milsim communities and modders made this more of an experience than some simple combat simulator - I was able to don exactly the same equipment, uniform and loadouts that I served with while in the army.
NOT worth it if you're playing vanilla arma - terrifying and immersive if you use mods.
You can eat, climb walls, abseil, drink, splint fractures, dress burns, dig foxholes, engage in melee, interrogate, be suppressed and find yourself in a house being breached and cleared by the enemy.

76561197971414496,107410,True,0.896043360233306885,"Arma 3 is a tricky game to review, but here‚Äôs me trying it anyway.

The reason why this game is so hard to review lies in the sheer size of the game and the variety of things it may or may not offer for the player.

I take Arma 3 for what it is first and foremost: a platform. What you get is a good looking game with a solid (would be great, but you have to do some optimization to boost your performance) engine, two amazing maps (Stratis and Altis, which is probably the most impressive map I‚Äôve seen in any open world-ish game) and the prospect of near endless new content from the community.

What you don‚Äôt get is an easy to get into mil-shooter with CoD sized maps and a quick pace. If you‚Äôre in for uncomplicated, fast paced PvP gameplay, you should probably look elsewhere. If you‚Äôre sick of that, however, Arma 3 might be just your thing. 

The strength of the Arma series is freedom (**** yeah). You are free to mod the game into almost anything you want, create any type of mission and make your very own gameplay experience. You have to invest some time into the game, but once you got into it, the opportunities are endless.

Want to play huge adversial or coop maps with a hundred players or more?  Arma is just your thing and there are big communities (in many different languages) that will help you find that epic experience.

Want to play singe player? Well, if you expect strong single player content with interesting characters and storyline and so on, then Arma 3 isn‚Äôt the game you‚Äôre looking for.  Or is it? Right now Bohemia delivered one part of a three part campaign ‚Äì those missions are challenging, offer a solid variety of infantry gameplay but don‚Äôt expect a good story or interesting characters. But as mentioned before ‚Äì the huge amount of community made missions and mods offer hours and hours of playtime.

Personally I prefer small cooperative missions to play with friends. Already the steam workshop has countless missions for 2-5 players. 

So, should you buy Arma 3? Well, I‚Äôd certainly recommend it, if any of the things I mentioned above sounds fun to you. It is to say though, that this game is not something that everyone might like, so stay away from it if you are not willing to invest some time into it.

I hope that this review helped some people to decide whether or not they should by Arma 3. Please note that I‚Äôm not a native English speaker, so the language used in this review might seem a little odd for some."

Briefly, I remember that every single second I've played this game is my favorite memory. As I do so, the developer's splash screen flashes on the screen, followed by the warm  welcome of the ARMA III logo and subsequent main menu screen. In this moment, I feel happy and fulfilled. The events of the real world bear no importance to me as I undertake the task of deciding what I'm going to get myself into today. Shall it be Altis life antics? Do I recreate the Osama Bin Laden raid with my friends? Should I attempt to put myself into the shoes of a Marine in the middle of the Tet Offensive of late 1968? My mind wanders into the child-like curiosity and the uncertainty of the events that will take place tonight, and therefore I am excited. This is my conscious mind.

76561198061699977,107410,True,0.889143705368041992,"[h1] The Big A3 [/h1]

[b] Welcome to Arma 3: The Big One [/b]

If you didn't just start PC gaming an hour ago, you've probably heard of Arma 3. Every time someone says the names Call of Duty, Battlefield, Squad, Red Orchestra, Verdun, or any other shooter title out there, they do so in hushed tones and with their hands over their mouths for fear of the inevitable tongue-lashing they're about to receive from an Arma fan.
Fans of the Arma series are fiercly loyal and totally uncompromising. I have little doubt you've heard the following phrases:

[list]
[*]""If you want [i] realism, [/i] you should play Arma.""
[*]""Only casuals play. . . .""
[*]""Arma 3 is way better because . . . .  and  . . . . ""
[/list]

It's annoying and inarguably elitist but, in their defense, also mostly true. Arma 3 is not for someone who is looking for a casual shooter experience. Arma 3 is for those of us that want to camp out in the trees, waiting for the three guys you saw 30 minutes before, and hoping you can pull of a successful ambush quickly, quietly, and without getting hit. Then, walking for another 30 minutes to link up with another squad, grab some vehicles, and truck a few kilometers out to set up a new FOB. You can expect to go upwards of 3 hours without firing a shot on certain servers.

Which brings me to my next point. . . 

[b] The Game Within a Game Within a Game Within a Game. . . . [/b]

One of A3's major selling points is it's massive, active, dedicated, and diverse community of modders. Arma 3 has a great single player campaign and a few nice King of the Hill and Wasteland servers that you will want to visit occasionally, but Arma gets particularly interesting when you go mod shopping. 

in the mood to lose track of 30 hours while you're dodging police officers and rival gangs as you fight to expand your criminal empire across Altis and/or Tanoa?
Asylum 'Life' servers are a personal favorite of mine. Complete with a living, player-driven economy, impactful politics between gangs and a police force trying to keep control of the island as these gangs throw lead and shade at one another in a constant struggle for turf. If that sounds familiar to you, make no mistake, GTA V doesn't come close to touching the complexity of Life servers.

There are mods for different eras of warfare, gamemodes for about anything you can imagine, and you can find most of them on Steam Workshop, making it easy to access and giving you infinite playtime. You literally cannot run out of things to do because there is [i] always [/i] more content.

I could honestly write about Arma all evening but I'll leave you with a few pros and cons and then I'll wrap things up for you.

[b] PROS: [/b]
[list]
[*]Infinite play value, you can never run out of content
[*]satisfying and memorable moments come to those with patience
[*]game modes for almost everything thanks to the modding community
[*]great graphics for excellent immersion
[*]Endless selection of weapons, vehicles, gear, etc.
[*]Shed your 'casual' title and pick up the mark of 'master' gamer
[/list]

[b] CONS: [/b]
[list]
[*]Arma 3 is not well optimized and is very CPU intensive. Still perfectly playable at 30fps though you will need a high end i7 if you expect to get anywhere near 60fps on most multiplayer servers. AMD users be warned.
[*]Seriously not for casual gamers. I cannot stress this enough. It can take hours to accomplish simple goals depending on your game mode. Highly satisfying when things come together, though.
[*]Expect to move slowly while learning controls. Arma 3 is a game that uses just about [i] all [/i] of your keyboard and it will take you a while to master.

[b] But Should I Buy It? [/b]

I can't recommend this game enough. But if you're a die-hard Call of Duty fan but you still pick up this title, you're in for a rude awakening. Casual gamers be warned."
76561198072447858,107410,True,0.889115750789642334,"What did you do today? I did walk into a stopsign and died in Arma 3.
Meh.. After 3099 hours and 15000 deaths later it's still a game you will return back to.
Thumbsup all the way."
76561198026803446,107410,True,0.888425886631011963,Just buy it. Look at how many hours I have in this game. It's the best money you'll ever spend. It is all things to all gamers.
76561197995591955,107410,True,0.88792949914932251,"Can't tell you if you should buy it or not, but I can tell you this.
You will find annoying bugs, highly requested features that isn't there and lack of content if you're not satisfied with what you have. 
But when you really get down to it, and experience some of the awesome scenarios you can get in multiplayer and custom sp mission, it's something magical you just can't find in any other game.

Arma is not a game which you pick up at launch, play the campaign and a bit of mp, and then trow away. You buy it, love it or hate it, and then play it forever or trow it away immediatly.
Arma is a game which you can never called finished. There will always be added to it, be it user or official content, fixes, features or optimizations. 

Hope I expressed myself correctly and that you learned something from it :)

If you like realistic shooters and organized large scale multiplayer warfare, this will be your gem!

I'll give it a 9/10, simply because: screw bugs, I've used hundreds of hours on Arma 3 that I would never take back.

Now, some people don't care much for the realism, and prefer action-movie esque shooters. That's fine. However, this game shines at gritty realistic firefights. There's nothing glorious about shouting contact reports into the radio, bounding cover to cover, and hoping the next round doesn't have your name on it, but when you're finally back on the bird with your buddies headed home, and you finally feel the sense of relief wash over you.

ArmA 2 was practically uknown until it's popularity was increased by DayZ. I found it interesting to jump into a BI (Bohemia Interactive) title that already had a steady fan-base behind it. Having been about a year since I purchased this game (launch) and over 100 hours of solid gameplay I feel that I can finally write a review that encompasses many of the aspects I have experienced within this game. Now I know what you're thinking: ""$59.99?! This isn't even considered a triple A title! That's like... that's like the price of CoD: Ghosts!"" Now, don't be intimidated by this price, for I can say that off the bat this game is worth a lot more than $59.99. From a value perspective, I found the price to be very reasonable based on the game's content nowadays.

Basically, ArmA is a series of hardcore military simulation; constantly reflecting real-world conditions into a video game. In ArmA 2, I feel that this was it's drawback, for there were certain scenarios where it was realistic to a point of frustration (breaking your leg on a 2 foot fall. It's a game guys, relax). ArmA 3 has found a good balance between an FPS/3rd Person shooter game and realism, making it extremely enjoyable as both a simulator [i] and [/i] a game. I also found that ArmA 3 has very good support for newbies to the series and is able to really engage players into the fun. I imagine it is much easier to get into ArmA 3 than I did ArmA 2 (I can't judge, I'm not new to it). 

The engine is decently optimized and is far less clunkier than the ArmA 2 engine, however rocks are still (and I guess forever will be) broken. Perhaps the game is having difficulty conforming such free player movement with an un-even surface. 

Pro tip: NEVER WALK ON ROCKS UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.

The game also has a variety of content; although players coming over from 2 will notice that there are A LOT less guns. This is partly due to the customization of guns. Instead of having a separate gun for each gun variation (M4A1 HOLO, M4A1 CCO, M4A1) you have a base gun and you are able to add sights, lasers, silencers, flashlights, what have you. However, this is not a full excuse- I feel that there are still a lesser amount of overall GUNS to shoot. Perhaps Bohemia Interactive is trying to fine-tune each gun into the patches as opposed to adding a ton of mediocre weapons simply for variety's sake. What's also very surprisingly good in this game is the Nvidia PhysX that was incorporated. Seeing my transport truck's wheels constantly bumping up and down according to the land under me while I drive troops through the night is oh-so-satisfying as well as, well... realistic! The physics engine has been extremely improved and I quite like it.

I'd like to finally talk about how the guns shoot and how they sound, for this is after all, a big part of the game. Once again I will compare it to ArmA 2, in saying clearly that ArmA 2 featured a more high-pitched ""tappy"" sound when you shot with vertical recoil, while 3 brings a much more deeper, louder shot as well as echo to accompany it as the gun travels backwards into your viewmodel as opposed to upwards. The guns definitely feel better for me, but in the end I'd like to classify this judgment as personal preference.

Lastly, the gamemodes of ArmA 3 are diverse and excellent, my favourite being Wasteland script. I won't go into detail here. There is also King of Hill, DayZ (OF COURSE, but it's MEH) and of course standard operations. Altis Life is also a really sweet one! Check those out if you end up buying.

So yeah, I really like this game and I think that there is so much potential for a growing community. Grab some buddies, hop into Stratis and keep overwatch with some snipers and riflers as you and your team move in through the bushes to grab an objective for more supplies for your squad! Really great game, I'd definitely recommend to any FPS/MILSIM fan! :D"

76561197963644421,107410,True,0.881744086742401123,"If you're coming to Arma 3 as an Arma series veteran, you already know what to expect. For the most part, the game hasn't changed since the last installment, but then it's always felt a little bit like Bohemia Interactive are still building on the groundwork laid back in 2001 by Operation Flashpoint, in the world's longest ever game of 'development Buckaroo'. Thankfully, the whole thing has yet to fall to pieces in any significant manner; it's quite happy to continue wobbling uneasily for now.

Arma has a reputation. It's known to be frighteningly obtuse, bewilderingly complex, and often hilariously broken. I can tell you right now that Arma 3 is no different, and absolutely still deserves that reputation. Thankfully, I don't think it's unfair to say that this is the closest an Arma game has come to being 'user friendly'. The controls have been tweaked, and the interface refined a little to accommodate more modern tastes. For these improvements alone, I do recommend it to newcomers to the series over any previous entry.
Coming from any other modern FPS game, it will still take a good few hours of what can feel an awful lot like hard work to get to grips with the controls, but I honestly think Arma 3 will see a far lower 'drop-out rate' of newbies who were frustrated to the point of giving up by the previous games.

At the time of writing, the elephant in the room is the lack of content available. When compared to Arma 2 (which is handsomely bolstered by an array of official expansion packs), the amount of hardware available to play with is frustratingly slim. In many cases, opposing armies are equipped with identical vehicles which get a slightly different paint job at best. For anyone used to the myriad of variants and oddments available in Arma 2, Arma 3 can feel awfully disappointing.
Fortunately, this is alleviated to some extent by the strong mod community. It has long been the case that the best parts of the Arma games are the parts not developed by Bohemia Interactive themselves, and Arma 3 is most definitely continuing this 'tradition'. Nevertheless, I can't help but feel that the game could've done with a few months more time in the oven before full public release.

Speaking of the mod community, I think it's criminal that almost none of the best, near-indispensible mods from Arma 2 have been officially integrated. For a self-professed 'war simulator', Arma 3 is hugely lacking in basic features like being able to rest your weapon on surfaces (even with a visible bipod), or tow damaged vehicles.

For all its flaws, though, Arma 3 is still a blast to play. If you can find a decent group of like-minded gamers with access to a voice-over-net server, you're in for some of the best gaming you'll ever experience. Sure, you'll probably have to load up on mods to satisfy your need for variety. And sure, sometimes the game will crash spectacularly, or the physics engine will flip out and kill you for standing too close to a wall. But when you're standing on a hilltop, looking out over an enemy outpost with your squadmates while a CAS helicopter strafes an enemy APC and spots targets for a distant sniper team; when everything clicks together in the way that only Arma can manage, you'll be glad to have been along for the ride."

76561198019977288,107410,True,0.875654399394989014,"I don't know where to start with this but let's just try:

My first experience with ArmA was with the Operation Flashpoint Series and later on with ArmA 1 (Cold war Assault) and then ArmA 2 (+ all possible Add-Ons).
And i just have to say, that i freakin fell in love with this game (ArmA3) from the very begining.

Sure there were heaves of problems, bugs and shit going wrong at the beginning but i still bought this game as soon as it was availabe (Which should've been like early Alpha or so).

But to explain why i sank over propably 2000 hours of my life into this game:

-Versatility: With the workshop added and all the mod support the game offers, it's just incredible for how long you are able to find new stuff. New Maps, weapons, uniforms, AI-Units, vehicles, helicopers, tanks, etc. etc.

-Versitility: With the ZEUS Modul and the Ed3n Editor you are able to creato soooooo much stuff. You can create YOUR OWN scenarios, and the overview them and change them while playing with zeus. if you play with a few people and you keep changing the missio maker you never ever ever run out of ideas/scenarios to play.

-Versitilititititiy: I think we've bee here before... With the huge mod support theres other beefits aswell. If you are playing onlie you will be able to find all sorts of server. wether you like playing as a lone wolf and kill other players, play in a huge team vs. AI encampments/bases, or just get flipping rich with selling apples. there's something for everyone out there.

But i don't want to hail everythig into the sky here, so here's a few negatives, which imo you should kow before you buy this:

-This game is in NO regards something for people lookig for a run & gun game. It's a Mil Sim after all.
-With the milsim aspect comes the complication of finding key bindings for everything you want to be able to do. so be preapared to learn buttloads of them (Especially with TFAR and ace in play).
-The graphics may look BRILLIANT on a good rig but if you are on minimum specs prepare for some frame problems,
 especially on bigger servers (although i have to say BI optimized a lot with the last few updates)

But other then that i can really just recommend this game if you are into military shooters that own you huge piles of different stuff.

And since my ""N"" key is fucked, here are some Ns for you guys that made it this far: n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n, n
That should've made up for the missed ones.

Cheers, Hydrox

76561198013541173,202970,True,0.623144686222076416,"Treyarch is particularly well-known for the Call of Duty video game series. Today, I would like to provide a review of the most recent release, Call of Duty: Black Ops II. This game has gained popularity among players due to its multiplayer mode, which is considered to be one of the best in the industry.
The online component of the game offers an immersive experience, allowing players to engage in intense battles with other players from around the world. Unlike previous iterations, there is no longer a need to switch servers to different countries, as players can now enjoy playing primarily with Russian opponents.
One of the standout features of this game is its impressive graphics and a wide range of weapons and perks available to players. While some may argue that the maps are smaller and more linear compared to other games, the lighting and overall gameplay are still excellent, providing a satisfying experience for players.
However, one drawback of the game's engine is that it has not been updated since 2007, which may lead to some technical issues for some players. Despite this, I recommend playing this game with friends, as it offers an enjoyable and challenging experience for those who enjoy shooters.

76561199015144202,2671060,False,0.956526696681976318,"Sadly, most of the content is badly designed RNG.

Personally i deem procedurally generated content to be a great way of increasing the variation and the longevity of content within a game.

However; if not enough care is taken to properly, and logically, integrate such content within a game this content can be very distracting, bad, and non-immersive.

The inclusion of legends could be grand for the game. To experience how your deeds not only influence the world, but also the tales told about your dynasty within it would be amazingly immersive. To see how bards, and sometimes you, twist truth into a more exciting form could be fun.

But sadly, legends fall under the category of badly procedurally generated content.

Take the following example:

My ruler was King Dumnarth of Cornwall. One of my favorite starts in 867, btw. It¬¥s fun to enter the fight for britain as a brythonic ruler.

King Dumnarth conquered the neighboring duchies of Wessex and Hwicce rather easily. And then, in a bid to increase his legitimacy and gather some prestige, he started spreading the legend that he and his line are descended from King Arthur.

While doing so Britanny was conquered by a norse Adventurer. King Dumnarth set sail in order to conquer free his bretic brethren from the Heathens. He won some great victories and drove them off, adding Britanny to his Demesne.

Then he proclaimed the Kingdom of Dumnonia. (Via the found a new kingdom decision, not the restore the kingdom of cornwall one.)

In gameplay terms this wasn¬¥t that much. In in-universe terms, though, this was something rather significant. A major victory against the Norse invaders was won and a new bretic kingdom, spanning the channel, formed.

This is the stuff of legends! What better to support his claim of descent from King Arthur, than to prove such undertakings!

However, it isn¬¥t reflected in the legend. At all.

The Legend fails in two ways, both the result of badly procedurally generated content. Content which is completely random, without being integrated in a sensible manner.

1.) It doesn¬¥t tie into the King Arthur myth at all. Arthur is mentioned once, but aside from this- nothing. It doesn¬¥t tie into this claim logically. A basic way this could, and has been done, would be to claim descent from him. Or to claim to have performed similiar feats. (Being visited by Merlin, finding excalibur, something.)

Instead the non-sensical claim of being birthed from a pool of blood and flesh is given. Yeah. Even though many people still alive in his kingdom will have known his parents. The same claim can be found in many other generated legends.

2.) It doesn¬¥t properly take into account which deeds of his have been noteworthy. I don¬¥t know how the selection works- If simply some deeds are eligible and some not, or if purely some random ones are chosen- But in this legend it didn¬¥t deign to mention his conquest of brittany and the victory over heathen invaders, nor does it mention the founding of a new kingdom.

Instead it chose to mention that one time he rode to some church, two baronies away from the border of his kingdom.

This isn¬¥t a fictionalised story of my character. This is [PICK RANDOM TEXT 1] + [PICK RANDOM TEXT 2] + [PICK RANDOM MEMORY FROM ROOT_CHARACTER].

This, in my opinion, should definitely be changed."

Plagues and new disease mechanics: Mostly part of the free patch and  as far as I can tell basically lifted 1:1 from CK2 and the parts that are part of the DLC are sold back to players at an insane price, despite the assertions from Paradox that they were going to take time to put thought into new systems and mechanics to expand the game past what existed in CK2 - at least characters actually die now though this entire change now continues the trend of adding more and more costs to the game with no way to supplement income the game is still functioning on the basic economy system from CK2 a game that is almost 15 years old

Legitimacy: A shoehorned system that just adds further hoops to jump through to keep vassals in line seems mostly designed to encourage people to use the horrible and repetitive hold court feature from Royal Court the other horrible content release for CK3 - just another random stat you have to manage to keep people from rebelling ever few years and even when you do manage it the system only serves to force you to play in one way

Funerals: 3 years into a game all about playing individual rulers, managing a family and eventually dying to only now be getting funerals (who knows when coronations, accessions or investiture ceremonies will be added but I won't hold my breath)

[u]Bloodlines in CK2[/u]
Bloodlines were not only more dynamic but also more fun to collect. One of my favourite things to do in Ck2 was to consolidate bloodlines through intricate breeding projects. It needed planning, patience, determination and knowledge of different game mechanics. If you did not start with a bloodline you also had the option to set an ambition to create one. These created bloodlines could vary [b]wildly[/b], from peaceful ruler to bloodthirsty murderer and gave permanent modifiers that corresponded with the type of bloodline. There were in total [b]THIRTY+[/b] unique bloodlines the player could create. These were great for RP and gameplay. You could look back at your ancestor and go, ""Damn that guy that got the warrior lodge bloodline was a badass"" while also getting the prowess from being related to him. 

[u]Legends in CK3[/u]
Legends of the dead gives you [b]FOUR[/b] types of legends. Heroic, saint, legitimacy and an unofficial ancestor one. 
Heroic gives you claims, saint converts your realm and legitimacy gives you legitimacy and ancestor let's you revive a dead culture. That's the long and the short of it. You get extra things like a special building slot and an artefact which are ok. The legend is not permanent and costs 1/4 of your income over five years to produce. During these five years you have little to no impact of what the ""legend"" will actually say. 

Most of the time the legend will be filled with what feels like ChatGPT gibberish of plagues, bandits and local lords. As such the legend description with the exception of some will feel the same. Conquering Byzantium, mending the Schism, dismantling the Papacy and restoring Rome legends were nearly indistinguishable from each other in my run. People also seem to have the memory of goldfish, legends like King Arthur which have been passed down from 12th century to today are seemingly forgotten within decades. Legends like King Arthur are also known worldwide and feature in the pop culture of nations thousands of kilometres from Wales. In CK3 you'll be lucky if the peasants in Rome even know who restored the empire because the legend can only expand to 501 baronies.

The three extra ones and the black death are also part of this DLC I guess. They're fine but with all the difficulty settings set to max they're at most a nuisance.

Legends are character-specific (No Legends that define your dynasty like CK2 Bloodlines) and while they can be inherited, they are not inherited by your heir, rather your legend goes to a arbitrarily-assigned dynasty member and frankly, I have no clue how the game decides who gets it. That's assuming you die soon enough for it to be inherited, since most legends deactivate after a few decades. Apparently single-handily stopping a viking invasion stops mattering after 20 years, and nobody cares if your father unified England and claimed descent from King Arthur.

Legitimacy is a complete joke. It's character-specific, not title specific, so the game does not care about the scenario the devs themselves pointed out (Whether or not a French warrior-prince should be considered the rightful ruler of Byzantium), as long as you were legitimate in whatever title you had before, you're legitimate in all of them. 

Also a sudden UI revamp that, while not that bad honestly, came out of nowhere and they replaced all the click sounds with a very annoying ""Sword unsheathe, sword sheath"" sound that grates on you very quickly. Again, nothing like this was mentioned in the dev diaries and there is currently no way to change it.

There is also none of the flavor additions that CK2's Reaper's Due DLC gave, such as multiple execution methods.

Paradox keeps on missing. They had a solid base in CK2 and instead of refining it or adapting it for CK3, they decided to get ''creative''. What they came up with falls short of anything they promised in the trailers and dev blogs.

- Legends disappear after 20-something years after being made. They don't require any specific actions unlike they did in CK2, essentially you pay once, and then wait for the map to be painted with ''your legend is spreading''
- More than half of the events that are supposed to increase legitimacy don't work, I've tried different events: tours, feasts, weddings, funerals, so on. Only feasts had an actual even that actually increased legitimacy.
- Legitimacy system in itself is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, you can have the same family ruling the kingdom/empire since the start of the game and some rulers will randomly start with legitimacy at max and others have it at maybe 1st or 2nd out of 5 levels.
- Plagues are nothing more than a nuisance and money sink for rebuilding efforts, and that's it. You'll see constant pop-ups ''Isolate yourself/capital'' each time any plague shows up on the  map. (A simple fix to that would be to make this option become an event ONLY when the plague reaches your personal domain - Paradox, take notes)"

Yet another DLC that adds new features that have a lot of promise, but needed significantly more development time to make them good. It seems like their business model these days is to create a barebones framework that the modders can finish for them.

I've played significantly more now and wow this DLC's new mechanics are a hot mess. I'll review it with the new free update.

1) Legitimacy. It's interesting, but not a single character starts with any levels of legitimacy, so the early game for everyone is just going to be a slog with needing to gain legitimacy

2) Diseases. oh diseases. This has been been something we have asked PDS to give us for several years now. It was a machochist's love from CK2, and now it's here, except now it's really annoying. diseases come every couple of years in random spots in the world, meaning if you're nearby any or you have a large empire, you're going to get event spammed with the same 3 events over and over and over again. the result from the events are never beneficial. they just happen. 

3) Legends. the big selling point and the thing actually on sale with this DLC is just ok. they're neat, but they are not spell/grammar checked at all, and are abusable. The AI will pursue legends, because why wouldn't you, and will often try to pay you to help spread the legend. but you spreading the legend costs gold per month to upkeep, so it really isn't worth your time much. so you can take their gold, and immediately stop promoting the legend. now if balance was a thing that existed, you might take a prestige hit, after all you just broke a deal? nope. maybe you lose some legitimacy, that cool new feature with this update? still no. ok, how about just an opinion hit? nope. It's free money, it's just free money. and that same character will try to pay you again a few months later, so we do the same thing again.
Legends spread from county to county based on who is spreading the legend and from a radius around where it originated, but there is a max to how far a legend can spread. The way it spreads is almost like a disease would spread, and that is probably why we got diseases in this update as well. Overall Legends are super underdeveloped and don't really add much to your gameplay

4) Funerals. Ah funerals the new activity you can do to gain legitimacy, lower stress, gain prestige, boost opinions, ... seduce someone, murder someone else. It's honestly a great activity. There's even an event during it where characters will reminisce on memories they have from the memories journal. except that characters don't generate memories of other characters at all, so the only thing they reminisce about them is when they declared war on them, slept with them, they died, or they killed them. most of the time they aren't even known as the killer. they just out themselves with a ""i killed him yeah""

This DLC is a super underdeveloped product and I genuinely cannot recommend this for $20. maybe try again when its on sale with a steep discount. and wait until it gets more patches to fix the glaring issues, which will probably never come."

The Legends: A cool concept that give good rewards but are effectively a money sink. Range from a simple boost to development and skill boosts to ""you now have a claim to every independent title in Iberia"". The events around legends can be enjoyable but once you promote one legend to mythical status, you have seen all the events (and even your first time there can be repetition). My biggest complaint is that legends only last 20 years once completed, even though, especially if your pushing mythical, it can be a multi-generational effort, and unless you go all the way some of the rewards are RNG.

Legitimacy: ok this is free update content but I need to rant somewhere, legitimacy is annoying. You lose way to much to plagues and losing a single battle but winning wars SOMETIMES give as much as back as losing a battle, but WINNING a battle outnumbered 3:1 does...nothing. Unless you do a legitimizing legend you can spend 50 years building up to level four, only for about 3-4 bad events in about the same amount of years knocks you to tier 3. And as for what tier is considered ""acceptable"" for your rank? Dont know, it bounced between 3-4 when I was a king, and always seemed to be where I was at least one level behind. Most of the advantages of high legitimacy are moot since unlike royal court each tier doesnt give benefits, only negates a penalty, while being over legitimacy is nigh impossible for kings who can actually make use of the bonuses like ""increased vassal acceptance chance"" but good luck maxing out the bar and keeping it for more then a year."

Let's get into fine details, shall we?

[h2]Plagues[/h2]

So, for the uninitiated, CK3 is a character-driven and focused RPG-meets-Sims game. Back when the game released 3 years ago, the design intent was to really invest into your characters, make them live long, have great education and congenital traits. The game really encouraged that with mechanics like Long/Short Reign, legacies like Octogenarians and Graceful Aging etc. However, a part of the community complained the game is not ""hardcore"" enough. As a result we got so called ""harm events"" in one of the updates, with the idea of randomly forcing death/crippling events on your characters and going completely against everything established previously. 

Plagues is the continuation of the trend. It adds the separate ""elderly heath"" stat to further cripple your characters beyond certain age, and otherwise all it does is randomly forces diseases on them. If previously my Rurik would live into his 60th - with this DLC he died in the early 50th from smallpox, and his son Helgi inherited at 27 and instantly got cancer. RIP. In the game where unplanned character death is akin to having your saves wiped it goes without saying how terrible these additions are. And the plagues are so constant that I eventually learned to live with them and ignore the constant buttons for ""Go into seclusion"" and ""Isolate the capital"" popping on my screen.

[h2]Legitimacy[/h2]

This mechanics is simple ""win more"" power creep that if you're a good player makes the game even easier and if you struggle makes it even worse for you. Win a few wars and do a feast and you notice it's easier to vassalize or make alliances. Lose a battle though, and you are hit with internal instability on top of that. Marry a beautiful lowborn girl and you're now hit with legitimacy penalty on top of the prestige one. The rising legitimacy expectations based on your rank are there to make it more difficult to keep kingdoms and empires together. However, this mechanics is superficial and in reality does little to change how the game is played. Like if you have the biggest army and the wealthiest domain around - you can pretty much forget legitimacy exists. 

[h2]Legends[/h2]

And this is a money sink. In the early game, maintaining and spreading a legend will cost you the money you could have spent on a large army, making it not really viable. And in the late game the rewards of the mechanics are pretty irrelevant. Imagine spending 3 legacy points to get a perk that grants your character a Saint trait, but you need to work for 100-200 years to complete a Mythic holy legend for it. The most important reward for legend completion are ""Legendary buildings"" - however those compete with existing Special buildings and Holy Sites for slots and end up being less powerful versions of those. This makes legends pointless if your domain is something like Paris or Rome, and while it could be useful if you want to make your domain in the middle of nowhere somewhat viable - you wouldn't have the funds to get it done in the first place. And the last reward is a book containing the legend (with random text which feels like written by ChatGPT) which only the character who completed the legend can commission for an additional sum of gold.

So there you have it - one mechanics that is harmful to the experience, one mechanics that is plain unnecessary, and one more that could be good if it wasn't half-baked and designed to be more than a money sink."

The pros are:

1) Plagues and Diseases are back. And they are a bit of fun.
2) It has some fun additions for Roleplaying purposes despite being more of a systemic pack.
3) The UI has gotten a lot better too. Espescially for some of the older mechanics as court positions.
4) While you could cheese Legitimacy and Legends it is more fun to let them run in a more role playing like style.

The cons are:

1) Legends could need more depth and there should be some more unique legends for many regions (Persia could need at least three more. Tibet also and why are things like the G√∂kturks not really a seed. I don't want to start with Africa).
2) Also there should be some ancestrial legends of your Dynasty in the late game.
3) The AI seems to have issues with legitimacy? I have the feel that they sometimes let it fall apart even with being able to avoid this situation.

For me it is a 7/10. It is not as good as Fate of Iberia or Tours and Tournaments and is a fine addition. Either get it in the Chaptr 3 Bundle or in a Sale as it is not amazing T&T or an all around good pack as Fate of Iberia.

Granted, a fair share of the core returning plague mechanics are part of the free ""scythe"" update, only some extra elements and more expanded bits are part of the DLC pack related to the plague mechanics such as funerals, additional varieties in plagues, more fleshed out Black Death. 

However the 2nd focus those being legends which sounded like about the same what we had with bloodlines in CK2's final update fall kinda flat due one major issue, there is no way extend a legend , legends you create for your character and dynasti fade away in mere years which makes no sense, this is an issue that honestly can very easily be fixed by simply increasing somewhat how long a legend can exist and adding some simple additional mechanic in which future generation can keep the family legends going and have them always be inherited. 

Due to to the issue of the bizarrely short legends, a lot of people who unlike me maybe weren't mainly excited for the plagues but instead for the legends mechanic were let down thus , this has dropped to mixed reviews but since i am someone who primarily was excited and focused on the plagues returning, the legends stuff was more of an extra side thing for me so it didn't bum me out when it turned out it has this weird design flaw that i do hope will be fixed.

So due to this, i am still really happy, i was so excited to see dynamic plagues and diseases come back , though i would suggest waiting for a bit of a discount on this DLC, it's more worth it for like 15 bucks, maybe a tad less, i did get mine from a 3rd party store where they had a slight discount dropping it to 15 which felt more fair then these bizzare new awful prices they hiked up for CK3 DLC a year or so ago.

I think the plague mechanics are fine, though the base system was added to the main game for free, so really you're just paying for a few extra potential negative modifiers, names of plagues, and one RNG event chain. Legitimacy is pretty interesting as well and makes the game more challenging by giving you more penalties for trying to marry Genius peasants into your bloodline. But, once again legitimacy was added to the base game for free so it's not something you're paying for. They're starting to add ""Sub-tasks"" that your court positions like the Physician can do, which is great and gives the player more control over their court, but once again that's free with the base game.

So, if most of the major features of the DLC are actually free with the base game, what do you get here? A couple of RNG event chains, a handful of new clothes, the ability to hold funerals, and Legends. Legends feels like something thrown together at the last second to justify this being a major update and ""Major"" DLC instead of a major update and minor DLC. Through the mechanic of ""Legends"" players are now supposed to be able to create lasting legends for their dynasty that make you out to be a hero, legitimize your dynasty's right to rule, or turn you into a saint among men. That all sounds great on paper, but in reality Legends are little more than an RNG gold sink. You have no real power over what your legend is about, what deeds it promotes, or what the final story will be, in fact the final legend feels like chatGPT was fed every memory of my character and then forced to spit out the most mundane drivel it could think of. 
""Here's the legend of how kind Midas walked two counties over to visit a church."" Meanwhile in my lifetime I united an entire kingdom and drove out a massive plague. The rewards for creating a Legend include an ok artifact, and a ""Legendary"" building. These legendary buildings compete for existing duchy buildings and are generally simply on par with what you can already build though they do have some nice models for the buildings. 
To top it off legends are not a permanent thing despite all the effort that goes into building them. Depending on how much money and effort you sunk into a legend it will stick around for between 20 and 100 years. That's right, you can create a ""Legend"" and still be alive when everyone has forgotten all about it. King Arthur who? Saint Edward, never heard of him. Now, I could see legends needing upkeep if the rewards were truly powerful, and the need to erase or supersede a legend to create a new one, but the fact that they're called LEGENDS and are forgotten in less than a generation is terrible design and it makes it feel pretty bad creating them.
CK2 already did legends better, they were called bloodlines. The devs need to take a look back at what they already did and improve upon it instead of creating worse, less interesting features.

Seeing my king create a legend at just 30 years old, only to see it totally disappear WHILE HE IS STILL ALIVE AND MAKING NEW CONQUESTS, sounds very stupid, doesn't it?

I hope that the community's comments will be listened to and that this problem will be solved, if not by Paradox then at least by the community itself (thanks to all the modders out there btw, you truly are the best that mankind can offer) which would save us again from a mechanic created and promptly abandoned.

So the plague system is basically Reapers DLC from CK2; diseases and plagues are more deadly and have more consequences, which is excellent.

Unfortunately, the Legends system is poorly implemented; legends are costly to maintain yet do not last very long; aside from the most important legitimacy gain, there really isn't any reason to interact with the Legends system. 
As mentioned, Legends lasts a very short while after it's completed, and without dynastic interaction or any interaction with conquered land, the legends mechanic feels really hollow and shallow a system.

Legitimacy itself is also not anything interesting. Firstly, legitimacy gives buffs and debuffs, but does not affect the way claims are pushed if anything it feels more like short reign and long reign debuff and buff, respectively and feels redundant with the way it is implemented. 

Secondly the easiest way to gain legitimacy is through warfare, as other activities such as feasts, tours and weddinngs etc. are very costly. This now discourages play styles do not involve warfare, for example diplomacy and intrigue play styles will generate little to no legitimacy which almost guarantees that you will have to play the game with a major debuff.

 
Overall the legends and Legitimacy mechanic has a lot of potential and perhaps in the future there would be a touch up on this DLC to smooth out the implementation of the mechanics.

The legends are really quite stale. On top of that it's weird that you build up the legend yourself, as if a legend is some sort of ""top down"" thing in our world, rather than a story that gets passed around a community until it becomes something more than whatever event touched it off. I understand this is a video game, and that it is a representation of the world rather than a mirror of it, but this is so awkward and false in its execution, in its logic, that I cannot look past it. 

Legitimacy, a new mechanic meant to reflect how your community/realm views you, seems like a great idea at the start. Except there really was a mechanic for it already, in your relationship to individual characters. Legitimacy is, by a modern definition, the personal belief in the authority of a figure or an institution. Now instead of your character having a personal relationship with every other character, and that reflecting their individual loyalties to you as a ruler, their opinion is collated into a monolithic bar that you must seek to fill with video game points. 

Again, it is a reflection of a reality, rather than a mirror, but there was already a much better reflection in the game. One that was far more subtle. 

In truth this betrays an even greater problem with the game. What is the difference between authority and power? Power is the ability to make someone do something through threat of violence. Authority is the ability to command someone righteously. The Catholic Church, as portrayed in the game, is barely an entity. In reality, in the Middle Ages, it was the authoritative institution of the West. 

To have any legitimacy in a ruler, in a representation of the Christian West, the Church must be the authority to dispense that legitimacy. 

Feasts and hunts and fine robes do not a King make. Not in this place and this time period (or ever really). The authority of such things has to be lodged in something more than the material world. It has to come from a metaphysical ideal. In that regard, CK3 is like a scientific treatise. It proffers a neutral, sterilized view of the world in which the only recognized legitimacy at all is the ability and willingness to use violence to get what you want.

Also some of the rewards for completing a legend (e.g. legendary artifact commission) require your legend to be present, first of all legends disappear COMPLETELY without trace after two decades at most, and when you use your legendary adventure casus belli before creating the artifact, and go somewhere remote, you will never be able to complete that artifact. It happened to me and I am still mad about it.
Plagues are interesting, and definitely add a much needed threat for the player - but it still feels like it could have been better, and IMO outbreaks seem to be biased to happen in the player's territory, or at least in close proximity.
On top of that, full of bugs, and it's a shame that this is the expected standard by now from Paradox.

Also, minor detail, but, on release day, in the Developer Livestream there was a question from the community if Isolationist cultures get a bonus to plague resistance, which was affirmed by a Dev, but in the game, if this is true, there is no indicator for it in the cultural tradition. I doubt they actually implemented it. Could be a honest mistake, or could be an indicator for greater issues at Paradox.

I have tried to be as optimistic and fair as possible but I just cannot understand the praise this DLC gets from the community. Compare it to Bloodlines in CK2 and it's just a pure joke.

This DLC is not substandard, it is not terribly unbalanced or anything like that. It is simply... meh. Legends fade way too quickly, you would think the exalted among men emperor of the newly restored Roman Empire, who claims to be the son of a lynx and visited by god would be something remembered forever in the annuals of history? Nope, in about two generations literally everybody has forgotten about him- Not even a mention of his name. The legends are generic too which really doesn't help the situation. The best example of this is Ottar ""Die Vogel"" of house Babenberger, a legendary ruler who restored the Holy Roman Empire from a mere county in Wien, destroying his enemies and launching grand holy wars into England, overrun by heathens. 

This sounds awesome right? Something mentioned in his legend ""Battle of Cumberland"" the battle which decided the fate of Scotland, England and Ireland? Nope, the legend mentions how he visited Canterbury and some generic event where he is 'visited by god' which is actually just a 100 year old randomly generated lowborn character, it doesn't even get the details of the battle itself correct, Ottar had no reinforcements or aid from anybody, his snake-like Karling allies refusing to aid him in his noble quest for Christendom... yet it says here how the battle was nearly lost (which is correct until a battle roll went in his favour) until his horsemen (the only men at arms unit I hadn't invested in) smashed through the enemy Varangian heavy infantry... a unit that counters heavy horsemen.

The legends in short are painfully generic, nothing unique about them exists. All the origin legends detail about how you were born from a pool of Ragnarr Lothbrok or Arthur Pendragon's own 'flesh and blood'. Cool, until you see it again, and again, and again and then some more halfway across the world. These origin legends are pretty much exclusive to Europe too, nothing in Persia claiming to be from the ages of Darius, nothing in Greece about Alexander the GREAT, nothing about Genghis Khan after he falls, imagine how cool that would be? Nope.

To conclude, all the legends feel like they were written by chat GPT, nothing unique or interesting about them, to add insult to injury, Ottar's statue didn't even have his name on it, just generic flavour text about a ruler immortalized in stone. His legend faded and in 2 generations, the legendary ruler of the HRE, destroyer of heathens, incredible commander and wily as a hawk had faded into complete obscurity, the only reminder of his existence being a small statue in Cumberland with a popular opinion boost.

This DLC is a for sure buy when it is on SALE, otherwise, it has nothing of value to add to this game. I hope the next one is a bit better.

It really feels like a much, much worse version of bloodlines to me.

Legitimacy feels very poorly balanced and overall just punitive and removing of more player agency over their realm. Perhaps there can be a proper balancing of it but it really feels far more stick than carrot. The legitimacy hits from disinheriting for example are needlessly expensive, especially when it's having secondary children take the vows...

Disease meanwhile feels marginally less fleshed out than in CK2 reapers due, ESPECIALLY in terms of Hospitals and Plague vulnerability/resistance, the barony buildings really feel less enjoyable to engage with than Hospitals in CK2.

legends are the most half baked feature to come out of ck3 yet. even court artefact spamming has some level of interaction with it, but legends are truly awful. its start legend, wait for a bit, mindlessly click through event spam about it (I have seen the same event 4 separate times in the same playthrough for multiple events), click button to upgrade, repeat this step again, then click complete, get some generic bonuses or some region specific claims, and now you can never use this legend again for the rest of the game. 

that's right, in a game about dynastic succession, about seeing how each character's actions build onto each other, only one character in your entire dynasty can use a legend seed. according to this dlc, if Louis the stammerer claimed to be the decedent of Charlemagne, none of his line afterwards could EVER claim the same again. the biggest middle finger to the player? after all is said and done, and you complete your so called 'legend', not only does it die off the map completely in just a few decades, but you cant even read the chronicle. that's right, the devs who claim this is a role-playing game as an excuse for giving us barely any mechanics besides event spam for 3 years, have the main role-play feature of their new dlc straight up disappear from player view almost instantly.
 
the common sense way to do this is have legends actually affect your dynasty long term, and give them a set of standards to adhere too to appear more like their claimed ancestor. If you want people to see you as the heir of Charlemagne, defeat the Saracens in battle, have a group of famed knights who you ride into battle with, be crowned by the pope, defeat rebellious vassals, etc. if you fail at these things, people will see you as not living up to your claimed ancestry, giving worse penalties then failing these things normally. the worst part is that most of these issues cant be fixed by modding. I have looked into (and posted) a mod that tries to fix legends, but with how fundamentally flawed the system at its core, a mod can only put a bandied on the bullet wound.

plagues are pretty solid, if deadly (as they should be to an extent), but could have used a bit more depth which they could have gotten if resources were not wasted on the abysmal legends system. pretty self explanatory tbh, if you have played ck2, they are not too different

as for bugs, I have noticed some with the new sound effects (which im not a fan of compared to the old), and some bigger ones, like a random unlanded character occupying land for some inexplicable reason.

overall legends are awful, being yet another event spam coated with an unintuitive ui over it, and the additions the dlc gives to plagues are not worth it, as most of the new plague mechanics are base game. skip if you didn't buy chapter 3, and if you were like me and got blinded by byzantine empire and landless hype and instantly clicked buy on chapter 3, lets pray that they make up for this. ck3 cant (or rather shouldn't) survive another year of disappointments like the last few."

Personally i deem procedurally generated content to be a great way of increasing the variation and the longevity of content within a game.

However; if not enough care is taken to properly, and logically, integrate such content within a game this content can be very distracting, bad, and non-immersive.

The inclusion of legends could be grand for the game. To experience how your deeds not only influence the world, but also the tales told about your dynasty within it would be amazingly immersive. To see how bards, and sometimes you, twist truth into a more exciting form could be fun.

But sadly, legends fall under the category of badly procedurally generated content.

Take the following example:

My ruler was King Dumnarth of Cornwall. One of my favorite starts in 867, btw. It¬¥s fun to enter the fight for britain as a brythonic ruler.

King Dumnarth conquered the neighboring duchies of Wessex and Hwicce rather easily. And then, in a bid to increase his legitimacy and gather some prestige, he started spreading the legend that he and his line are descended from King Arthur.

While doing so Britanny was conquered by a norse Adventurer. King Dumnarth set sail in order to conquer free his bretic brethren from the Heathens. He won some great victories and drove them off, adding Britanny to his Demesne.

Then he proclaimed the Kingdom of Dumnonia. (Via the found a new kingdom decision, not the restore the kingdom of cornwall one.)

In gameplay terms this wasn¬¥t that much. In in-universe terms, though, this was something rather significant. A major victory against the Norse invaders was won and a new bretic kingdom, spanning the channel, formed.

This is the stuff of legends! What better to support his claim of descent from King Arthur, than to prove such undertakings!

However, it isn¬¥t reflected in the legend. At all.

The Legend fails in two ways, both the result of badly procedurally generated content. Content which is completely random, without being integrated in a sensible manner.

1.) It doesn¬¥t tie into the King Arthur myth at all. Arthur is mentioned once, but aside from this- nothing. It doesn¬¥t tie into this claim logically. A basic way this could, and has been done, would be to claim descent from him. Or to claim to have performed similiar feats. (Being visited by Merlin, finding excalibur, something.)

Instead the non-sensical claim of being birthed from a pool of blood and flesh is given. Yeah. Even though many people still alive in his kingdom will have known his parents. The same claim can be found in many other generated legends.

2.) It doesn¬¥t properly take into account which deeds of his have been noteworthy. I don¬¥t know how the selection works- If simply some deeds are eligible and some not, or if purely some random ones are chosen- But in this legend it didn¬¥t deign to mention his conquest of brittany and the victory over heathen invaders, nor does it mention the founding of a new kingdom.

Instead it chose to mention that one time he rode to some church, two baronies away from the border of his kingdom.

Plagues and new disease mechanics: Mostly part of the free patch and  as far as I can tell basically lifted 1:1 from CK2 and the parts that are part of the DLC are sold back to players at an insane price, despite the assertions from Paradox that they were going to take time to put thought into new systems and mechanics to expand the game past what existed in CK2 - at least characters actually die now though this entire change now continues the trend of adding more and more costs to the game with no way to supplement income the game is still functioning on the basic economy system from CK2 a game that is almost 15 years old

Legitimacy: A shoehorned system that just adds further hoops to jump through to keep vassals in line seems mostly designed to encourage people to use the horrible and repetitive hold court feature from Royal Court the other horrible content release for CK3 - just another random stat you have to manage to keep people from rebelling ever few years and even when you do manage it the system only serves to force you to play in one way

Bloodlines were not only more dynamic but also more fun to collect. One of my favourite things to do in Ck2 was to consolidate bloodlines through intricate breeding projects. It needed planning, patience, determination and knowledge of different game mechanics. If you did not start with a bloodline you also had the option to set an ambition to create one. These created bloodlines could vary [b]wildly[/b], from peaceful ruler to bloodthirsty murderer and gave permanent modifiers that corresponded with the type of bloodline. There were in total [b]THIRTY+[/b] unique bloodlines the player could create. These were great for RP and gameplay. You could look back at your ancestor and go, ""Damn that guy that got the warrior lodge bloodline was a badass"" while also getting the prowess from being related to him. 

[u]Legends in CK3[/u]
Legends of the dead gives you [b]FOUR[/b] types of legends. Heroic, saint, legitimacy and an unofficial ancestor one. 
Heroic gives you claims, saint converts your realm and legitimacy gives you legitimacy and ancestor let's you revive a dead culture. That's the long and the short of it. You get extra things like a special building slot and an artefact which are ok. The legend is not permanent and costs 1/4 of your income over five years to produce. During these five years you have little to no impact of what the ""legend"" will actually say. 

Most of the time the legend will be filled with what feels like ChatGPT gibberish of plagues, bandits and local lords. As such the legend description with the exception of some will feel the same. Conquering Byzantium, mending the Schism, dismantling the Papacy and restoring Rome legends were nearly indistinguishable from each other in my run. People also seem to have the memory of goldfish, legends like King Arthur which have been passed down from 12th century to today are seemingly forgotten within decades. Legends like King Arthur are also known worldwide and feature in the pop culture of nations thousands of kilometres from Wales. In CK3 you'll be lucky if the peasants in Rome even know who restored the empire because the legend can only expand to 501 baronies.

[u]Plagues[/u]
The three extra ones and the black death are also part of this DLC I guess. They're fine but with all the difficulty settings set to max they're at most a nuisance.

[u]Tl;dr[/u]

76561198354682550,2671060,False,0.887179076671600342,"Plagues are the only thing remotely well-implemented in this DLC.

Legends are character-specific (No Legends that define your dynasty like CK2 Bloodlines) and while they can be inherited, they are not inherited by your heir, rather your legend goes to a arbitrarily-assigned dynasty member and frankly, I have no clue how the game decides who gets it. That's assuming you die soon enough for it to be inherited, since most legends deactivate after a few decades. Apparently single-handily stopping a viking invasion stops mattering after 20 years, and nobody cares if your father unified England and claimed descent from King Arthur.

Legitimacy is a complete joke. It's character-specific, not title specific, so the game does not care about the scenario the devs themselves pointed out (Whether or not a French warrior-prince should be considered the rightful ruler of Byzantium), as long as you were legitimate in whatever title you had before, you're legitimate in all of them. 

Also a sudden UI revamp that, while not that bad honestly, came out of nowhere and they replaced all the click sounds with a very annoying ""Sword unsheathe, sword sheath"" sound that grates on you very quickly. Again, nothing like this was mentioned in the dev diaries and there is currently no way to change it.

There is also none of the flavor additions that CK2's Reaper's Due DLC gave, such as multiple execution methods.

Also, they forgot that Vikings already had funeral events, so Vikings get to bury their dead family members twice (Once for Northern Lords event, another for the new Burial tenet)"

Paradox keeps on missing. They had a solid base in CK2 and instead of refining it or adapting it for CK3, they decided to get ''creative''. What they came up with falls short of anything they promised in the trailers and dev blogs.

- Legends disappear after 20-something years after being made. They don't require any specific actions unlike they did in CK2, essentially you pay once, and then wait for the map to be painted with ''your legend is spreading''
- More than half of the events that are supposed to increase legitimacy don't work, I've tried different events: tours, feasts, weddings, funerals, so on. Only feasts had an actual even that actually increased legitimacy.
- Legitimacy system in itself is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, you can have the same family ruling the kingdom/empire since the start of the game and some rulers will randomly start with legitimacy at max and others have it at maybe 1st or 2nd out of 5 levels.
- Plagues are nothing more than a nuisance and money sink for rebuilding efforts, and that's it. You'll see constant pop-ups ''Isolate yourself/capital'' each time any plague shows up on the  map. (A simple fix to that would be to make this option become an event ONLY when the plague reaches your personal domain - Paradox, take notes)"

Yet another DLC that adds new features that have a lot of promise, but needed significantly more development time to make them good. It seems like their business model these days is to create a barebones framework that the modders can finish for them.

I've played significantly more now and wow this DLC's new mechanics are a hot mess. I'll review it with the new free update.

1) Legitimacy. It's interesting, but not a single character starts with any levels of legitimacy, so the early game for everyone is just going to be a slog with needing to gain legitimacy

2) Diseases. oh diseases. This has been been something we have asked PDS to give us for several years now. It was a machochist's love from CK2, and now it's here, except now it's really annoying. diseases come every couple of years in random spots in the world, meaning if you're nearby any or you have a large empire, you're going to get event spammed with the same 3 events over and over and over again. the result from the events are never beneficial. they just happen. 

3) Legends. the big selling point and the thing actually on sale with this DLC is just ok. they're neat, but they are not spell/grammar checked at all, and are abusable. The AI will pursue legends, because why wouldn't you, and will often try to pay you to help spread the legend. but you spreading the legend costs gold per month to upkeep, so it really isn't worth your time much. so you can take their gold, and immediately stop promoting the legend. now if balance was a thing that existed, you might take a prestige hit, after all you just broke a deal? nope. maybe you lose some legitimacy, that cool new feature with this update? still no. ok, how about just an opinion hit? nope. It's free money, it's just free money. and that same character will try to pay you again a few months later, so we do the same thing again.
Legends spread from county to county based on who is spreading the legend and from a radius around where it originated, but there is a max to how far a legend can spread. The way it spreads is almost like a disease would spread, and that is probably why we got diseases in this update as well. Overall Legends are super underdeveloped and don't really add much to your gameplay

4) Funerals. Ah funerals the new activity you can do to gain legitimacy, lower stress, gain prestige, boost opinions, ... seduce someone, murder someone else. It's honestly a great activity. There's even an event during it where characters will reminisce on memories they have from the memories journal. except that characters don't generate memories of other characters at all, so the only thing they reminisce about them is when they declared war on them, slept with them, they died, or they killed them. most of the time they aren't even known as the killer. they just out themselves with a ""i killed him yeah""

This DLC is a super underdeveloped product and I genuinely cannot recommend this for $20. maybe try again when its on sale with a steep discount. and wait until it gets more patches to fix the glaring issues, which will probably never come."

But instead with this dlc, a legend only stays around for 100 years when you get it to mythical tier on the COUNTIES, not your dynasty. CK 2 did this much much better. No legend is permenant in this DLC. Legends should be completely permenant like how we know about King Arthur Pendragon to this day and how some dynasties in history claimed to be coming from them.

The Legends: A cool concept that give good rewards but are effectively a money sink. Range from a simple boost to development and skill boosts to ""you now have a claim to every independent title in Iberia"". The events around legends can be enjoyable but once you promote one legend to mythical status, you have seen all the events (and even your first time there can be repetition). My biggest complaint is that legends only last 20 years once completed, even though, especially if your pushing mythical, it can be a multi-generational effort, and unless you go all the way some of the rewards are RNG.

The dead: Imma be 100% funerals should have been part of the free update. The plagues are ok, adding to the chaos of the game and a more dynamic if intangible threat, and diseases are now actually scary at times. Havnt actually played long enough to see the black death so cant comment on it but from what I have seen from the community it seems pretty interesting, though you lose a absolute ton of development. Overall 7/10, you get whats on the tin.

Legitimacy: ok this is free update content but I need to rant somewhere, legitimacy is annoying. You lose way to much to plagues and losing a single battle but winning wars SOMETIMES give as much as back as losing a battle, but WINNING a battle outnumbered 3:1 does...nothing. Unless you do a legitimizing legend you can spend 50 years building up to level four, only for about 3-4 bad events in about the same amount of years knocks you to tier 3. And as for what tier is considered ""acceptable"" for your rank? Dont know, it bounced between 3-4 when I was a king, and always seemed to be where I was at least one level behind. Most of the advantages of high legitimacy are moot since unlike royal court each tier doesnt give benefits, only negates a penalty, while being over legitimacy is nigh impossible for kings who can actually make use of the bonuses like ""increased vassal acceptance chance"" but good luck maxing out the bar and keeping it for more then a year."

This DLC is a step back from the Bloodlines DLC from CK2 for the cost of the same price.

Legitimacy is a new mechanic tied to the legends feature, but you don't need the DLC to have this mechanic. If you are an usurper or startup ruler, you will have a slight struggle especially if your vassals are of different culture than you and your cultural acceptance is low. This mechanic adds a slight complexity on how vassals will accept your rule but overall not that impactful.

Plagues are another new mechanic added to the game which is basically also not that impactful since plague strength isn't that optimized even at full strength. You'll see ""casualties"" pertaining to the plague in question but it'll usually fizzle out before even killing 100 people, which is kinda underwhelming. I had to tell my court physician not to help with the plague so that I could actually experience the mechanic on my city. There are also no random events tied to plagues like not washing your hands after a hunt or falling into a latrine, causing a plague on your household if you have low learning, etc. Overall, plagues appear to be quite bland and just spams you with notifications of plagues that are just minor annoyances.

Let's get into fine details, shall we?

[h2]Plagues[/h2]

So, for the uninitiated, CK3 is a character-driven and focused RPG-meets-Sims game. Back when the game released 3 years ago, the design intent was to really invest into your characters, make them live long, have great education and congenital traits. The game really encouraged that with mechanics like Long/Short Reign, legacies like Octogenarians and Graceful Aging etc. However, a part of the community complained the game is not ""hardcore"" enough. As a result we got so called ""harm events"" in one of the updates, with the idea of randomly forcing death/crippling events on your characters and going completely against everything established previously. 

Plagues is the continuation of the trend. It adds the separate ""elderly heath"" stat to further cripple your characters beyond certain age, and otherwise all it does is randomly forces diseases on them. If previously my Rurik would live into his 60th - with this DLC he died in the early 50th from smallpox, and his son Helgi inherited at 27 and instantly got cancer. RIP. In the game where unplanned character death is akin to having your saves wiped it goes without saying how terrible these additions are. And the plagues are so constant that I eventually learned to live with them and ignore the constant buttons for ""Go into seclusion"" and ""Isolate the capital"" popping on my screen.

[h2]Legitimacy[/h2]

This mechanics is simple ""win more"" power creep that if you're a good player makes the game even easier and if you struggle makes it even worse for you. Win a few wars and do a feast and you notice it's easier to vassalize or make alliances. Lose a battle though, and you are hit with internal instability on top of that. Marry a beautiful lowborn girl and you're now hit with legitimacy penalty on top of the prestige one. The rising legitimacy expectations based on your rank are there to make it more difficult to keep kingdoms and empires together. However, this mechanics is superficial and in reality does little to change how the game is played. Like if you have the biggest army and the wealthiest domain around - you can pretty much forget legitimacy exists. 

[h2]Legends[/h2]

And this is a money sink. In the early game, maintaining and spreading a legend will cost you the money you could have spent on a large army, making it not really viable. And in the late game the rewards of the mechanics are pretty irrelevant. Imagine spending 3 legacy points to get a perk that grants your character a Saint trait, but you need to work for 100-200 years to complete a Mythic holy legend for it. The most important reward for legend completion are ""Legendary buildings"" - however those compete with existing Special buildings and Holy Sites for slots and end up being less powerful versions of those. This makes legends pointless if your domain is something like Paris or Rome, and while it could be useful if you want to make your domain in the middle of nowhere somewhat viable - you wouldn't have the funds to get it done in the first place. And the last reward is a book containing the legend (with random text which feels like written by ChatGPT) which only the character who completed the legend can commission for an additional sum of gold.

So there you have it - one mechanics that is harmful to the experience, one mechanics that is plain unnecessary, and one more that could be good if it wasn't half-baked and designed to be more than a money sink."

The pros are:

1) Plagues and Diseases are back. And they are a bit of fun.
2) It has some fun additions for Roleplaying purposes despite being more of a systemic pack.
3) The UI has gotten a lot better too. Espescially for some of the older mechanics as court positions.
4) While you could cheese Legitimacy and Legends it is more fun to let them run in a more role playing like style.

The cons are:

1) Legends could need more depth and there should be some more unique legends for many regions (Persia could need at least three more. Tibet also and why are things like the G√∂kturks not really a seed. I don't want to start with Africa).
2) Also there should be some ancestrial legends of your Dynasty in the late game.
3) The AI seems to have issues with legitimacy? I have the feel that they sometimes let it fall apart even with being able to avoid this situation.

For me it is a 7/10. It is not as good as Fate of Iberia or Tours and Tournaments and is a fine addition. Either get it in the Chaptr 3 Bundle or in a Sale as it is not amazing T&T or an all around good pack as Fate of Iberia.

I recommend buying it on sale or getting the bundle because Roads to Power seems like it will actually be great.

The plague system suits me, most are small and have only slim consequences, if you're paying attention you probably aren't ever going to have an issue beyond big plagues (100 years of playing in conflict torn Britania I ran into three plagues that actually caused me problems, one which tore through a lot of people). 

I feel like they were trying to introduce plagues without the ""haha you randomly died"" since they got such a bad reception with that during their last expansions, however plagues is probably the only place it's actually warranted lol

Onto Legends and Legitimacy. Legends have almost no lasting effects on your family, some of them are really cool, some of the vikings get a ""legendary adventure"" which allows you to basically leave your kingdom and go somewhere else again which wraps up nicely with their wrath of the norsemen side. I was loving it, until I died and i realised that it barely mattered and just slowly lagged out leaving no mark on my dynasty. 

Legitimacy is cool, I've had no bugs or anything that others are reporting but I absolutely hate that nobody seems to be playing by the same legitimacy rules as me, no flavour around chipping away at peoples legitimacy, sabotaging them etc etc especially interfamily

Granted, a fair share of the core returning plague mechanics are part of the free ""scythe"" update, only some extra elements and more expanded bits are part of the DLC pack related to the plague mechanics such as funerals, additional varieties in plagues, more fleshed out Black Death. 

However the 2nd focus those being legends which sounded like about the same what we had with bloodlines in CK2's final update fall kinda flat due one major issue, there is no way extend a legend , legends you create for your character and dynasti fade away in mere years which makes no sense, this is an issue that honestly can very easily be fixed by simply increasing somewhat how long a legend can exist and adding some simple additional mechanic in which future generation can keep the family legends going and have them always be inherited. 

Due to to the issue of the bizarrely short legends, a lot of people who unlike me maybe weren't mainly excited for the plagues but instead for the legends mechanic were let down thus , this has dropped to mixed reviews but since i am someone who primarily was excited and focused on the plagues returning, the legends stuff was more of an extra side thing for me so it didn't bum me out when it turned out it has this weird design flaw that i do hope will be fixed.

So due to this, i am still really happy, i was so excited to see dynamic plagues and diseases come back , though i would suggest waiting for a bit of a discount on this DLC, it's more worth it for like 15 bucks, maybe a tad less, i did get mine from a 3rd party store where they had a slight discount dropping it to 15 which felt more fair then these bizzare new awful prices they hiked up for CK3 DLC a year or so ago.

I think the plague mechanics are fine, though the base system was added to the main game for free, so really you're just paying for a few extra potential negative modifiers, names of plagues, and one RNG event chain. Legitimacy is pretty interesting as well and makes the game more challenging by giving you more penalties for trying to marry Genius peasants into your bloodline. But, once again legitimacy was added to the base game for free so it's not something you're paying for. They're starting to add ""Sub-tasks"" that your court positions like the Physician can do, which is great and gives the player more control over their court, but once again that's free with the base game.

So, if most of the major features of the DLC are actually free with the base game, what do you get here? A couple of RNG event chains, a handful of new clothes, the ability to hold funerals, and Legends. Legends feels like something thrown together at the last second to justify this being a major update and ""Major"" DLC instead of a major update and minor DLC. Through the mechanic of ""Legends"" players are now supposed to be able to create lasting legends for their dynasty that make you out to be a hero, legitimize your dynasty's right to rule, or turn you into a saint among men. That all sounds great on paper, but in reality Legends are little more than an RNG gold sink. You have no real power over what your legend is about, what deeds it promotes, or what the final story will be, in fact the final legend feels like chatGPT was fed every memory of my character and then forced to spit out the most mundane drivel it could think of. 
""Here's the legend of how kind Midas walked two counties over to visit a church."" Meanwhile in my lifetime I united an entire kingdom and drove out a massive plague. The rewards for creating a Legend include an ok artifact, and a ""Legendary"" building. These legendary buildings compete for existing duchy buildings and are generally simply on par with what you can already build though they do have some nice models for the buildings. 
To top it off legends are not a permanent thing despite all the effort that goes into building them. Depending on how much money and effort you sunk into a legend it will stick around for between 20 and 100 years. That's right, you can create a ""Legend"" and still be alive when everyone has forgotten all about it. King Arthur who? Saint Edward, never heard of him. Now, I could see legends needing upkeep if the rewards were truly powerful, and the need to erase or supersede a legend to create a new one, but the fact that they're called LEGENDS and are forgotten in less than a generation is terrible design and it makes it feel pretty bad creating them.
CK2 already did legends better, they were called bloodlines. The devs need to take a look back at what they already did and improve upon it instead of creating worse, less interesting features.

So the plague system is basically Reapers DLC from CK2; diseases and plagues are more deadly and have more consequences, which is excellent.

Unfortunately, the Legends system is poorly implemented; legends are costly to maintain yet do not last very long; aside from the most important legitimacy gain, there really isn't any reason to interact with the Legends system. 
As mentioned, Legends lasts a very short while after it's completed, and without dynastic interaction or any interaction with conquered land, the legends mechanic feels really hollow and shallow a system.

Legitimacy itself is also not anything interesting. Firstly, legitimacy gives buffs and debuffs, but does not affect the way claims are pushed if anything it feels more like short reign and long reign debuff and buff, respectively and feels redundant with the way it is implemented. 

Secondly the easiest way to gain legitimacy is through warfare, as other activities such as feasts, tours and weddinngs etc. are very costly. This now discourages play styles do not involve warfare, for example diplomacy and intrigue play styles will generate little to no legitimacy which almost guarantees that you will have to play the game with a major debuff.

 
Overall the legends and Legitimacy mechanic has a lot of potential and perhaps in the future there would be a touch up on this DLC to smooth out the implementation of the mechanics.

The legends are really quite stale. On top of that it's weird that you build up the legend yourself, as if a legend is some sort of ""top down"" thing in our world, rather than a story that gets passed around a community until it becomes something more than whatever event touched it off. I understand this is a video game, and that it is a representation of the world rather than a mirror of it, but this is so awkward and false in its execution, in its logic, that I cannot look past it. 

Legitimacy, a new mechanic meant to reflect how your community/realm views you, seems like a great idea at the start. Except there really was a mechanic for it already, in your relationship to individual characters. Legitimacy is, by a modern definition, the personal belief in the authority of a figure or an institution. Now instead of your character having a personal relationship with every other character, and that reflecting their individual loyalties to you as a ruler, their opinion is collated into a monolithic bar that you must seek to fill with video game points. 

Again, it is a reflection of a reality, rather than a mirror, but there was already a much better reflection in the game. One that was far more subtle. 

In truth this betrays an even greater problem with the game. What is the difference between authority and power? Power is the ability to make someone do something through threat of violence. Authority is the ability to command someone righteously. The Catholic Church, as portrayed in the game, is barely an entity. In reality, in the Middle Ages, it was the authoritative institution of the West. 

To have any legitimacy in a ruler, in a representation of the Christian West, the Church must be the authority to dispense that legitimacy. 

Feasts and hunts and fine robes do not a King make. Not in this place and this time period (or ever really). The authority of such things has to be lodged in something more than the material world. It has to come from a metaphysical ideal. In that regard, CK3 is like a scientific treatise. It proffers a neutral, sterilized view of the world in which the only recognized legitimacy at all is the ability and willingness to use violence to get what you want.

You are meant to get legitimacy by going to war and doing events but while between 0-100 you only sometimes get legitimacy going to war and about 10 for an event so good luck spamming feasts and hunts for 30 years and hope you can get out of the death spiral.
Finally the worst thing to come from this is certain starting character start with high legitimacy and so they have more power and they have the power to vassalize people even if those people are not de jure apart of their duchy or kingdom.

It happened to me and I am still mad about it.
Plagues are interesting, and definitely add a much needed threat for the player - but it still feels like it could have been better, and IMO outbreaks seem to be biased to happen in the player's territory, or at least in close proximity.
On top of that, full of bugs, and it's a shame that this is the expected standard by now from Paradox.

Also, minor detail, but, on release day, in the Developer Livestream there was a question from the community if Isolationist cultures get a bonus to plague resistance, which was affirmed by a Dev, but in the game, if this is true, there is no indicator for it in the cultural tradition. I doubt they actually implemented it. Could be a honest mistake, or could be an indicator for greater issues at Paradox.

I have tried to be as optimistic and fair as possible but I just cannot understand the praise this DLC gets from the community. Compare it to Bloodlines in CK2 and it's just a pure joke.

This DLC is not substandard, it is not terribly unbalanced or anything like that. It is simply... meh. Legends fade way too quickly, you would think the exalted among men emperor of the newly restored Roman Empire, who claims to be the son of a lynx and visited by god would be something remembered forever in the annuals of history? Nope, in about two generations literally everybody has forgotten about him- Not even a mention of his name. The legends are generic too which really doesn't help the situation. The best example of this is Ottar ""Die Vogel"" of house Babenberger, a legendary ruler who restored the Holy Roman Empire from a mere county in Wien, destroying his enemies and launching grand holy wars into England, overrun by heathens. 

This sounds awesome right? Something mentioned in his legend ""Battle of Cumberland"" the battle which decided the fate of Scotland, England and Ireland? Nope, the legend mentions how he visited Canterbury and some generic event where he is 'visited by god' which is actually just a 100 year old randomly generated lowborn character, it doesn't even get the details of the battle itself correct, Ottar had no reinforcements or aid from anybody, his snake-like Karling allies refusing to aid him in his noble quest for Christendom... yet it says here how the battle was nearly lost (which is correct until a battle roll went in his favour) until his horsemen (the only men at arms unit I hadn't invested in) smashed through the enemy Varangian heavy infantry... a unit that counters heavy horsemen.

The legends in short are painfully generic, nothing unique about them exists. All the origin legends detail about how you were born from a pool of Ragnarr Lothbrok or Arthur Pendragon's own 'flesh and blood'. Cool, until you see it again, and again, and again and then some more halfway across the world. These origin legends are pretty much exclusive to Europe too, nothing in Persia claiming to be from the ages of Darius, nothing in Greece about Alexander the GREAT, nothing about Genghis Khan after he falls, imagine how cool that would be? Nope.

To conclude, all the legends feel like they were written by chat GPT, nothing unique or interesting about them, to add insult to injury, Ottar's statue didn't even have his name on it, just generic flavour text about a ruler immortalized in stone. His legend faded and in 2 generations, the legendary ruler of the HRE, destroyer of heathens, incredible commander and wily as a hawk had faded into complete obscurity, the only reminder of his existence being a small statue in Cumberland with a popular opinion boost.

It really feels like a much, much worse version of bloodlines to me.

Legitimacy feels very poorly balanced and overall just punitive and removing of more player agency over their realm. Perhaps there can be a proper balancing of it but it really feels far more stick than carrot. The legitimacy hits from disinheriting for example are needlessly expensive, especially when it's having secondary children take the vows...

Disease meanwhile feels marginally less fleshed out than in CK2 reapers due, ESPECIALLY in terms of Hospitals and Plague vulnerability/resistance, the barony buildings really feel less enjoyable to engage with than Hospitals in CK2.

legends are the most half baked feature to come out of ck3 yet. even court artefact spamming has some level of interaction with it, but legends are truly awful. its start legend, wait for a bit, mindlessly click through event spam about it (I have seen the same event 4 separate times in the same playthrough for multiple events), click button to upgrade, repeat this step again, then click complete, get some generic bonuses or some region specific claims, and now you can never use this legend again for the rest of the game. 

that's right, in a game about dynastic succession, about seeing how each character's actions build onto each other, only one character in your entire dynasty can use a legend seed. according to this dlc, if Louis the stammerer claimed to be the decedent of Charlemagne, none of his line afterwards could EVER claim the same again. the biggest middle finger to the player? after all is said and done, and you complete your so called 'legend', not only does it die off the map completely in just a few decades, but you cant even read the chronicle. that's right, the devs who claim this is a role-playing game as an excuse for giving us barely any mechanics besides event spam for 3 years, have the main role-play feature of their new dlc straight up disappear from player view almost instantly.
 
the common sense way to do this is have legends actually affect your dynasty long term, and give them a set of standards to adhere too to appear more like their claimed ancestor. If you want people to see you as the heir of Charlemagne, defeat the Saracens in battle, have a group of famed knights who you ride into battle with, be crowned by the pope, defeat rebellious vassals, etc. if you fail at these things, people will see you as not living up to your claimed ancestry, giving worse penalties then failing these things normally. the worst part is that most of these issues cant be fixed by modding. I have looked into (and posted) a mod that tries to fix legends, but with how fundamentally flawed the system at its core, a mod can only put a bandied on the bullet wound.

plagues are pretty solid, if deadly (as they should be to an extent), but could have used a bit more depth which they could have gotten if resources were not wasted on the abysmal legends system. pretty self explanatory tbh, if you have played ck2, they are not too different

as for bugs, I have noticed some with the new sound effects (which im not a fan of compared to the old), and some bigger ones, like a random unlanded character occupying land for some inexplicable reason.

overall legends are awful, being yet another event spam coated with an unintuitive ui over it, and the additions the dlc gives to plagues are not worth it, as most of the new plague mechanics are base game. skip if you didn't buy chapter 3, and if you were like me and got blinded by byzantine empire and landless hype and instantly clicked buy on chapter 3, lets pray that they make up for this. ck3 cant (or rather shouldn't) survive another year of disappointments like the last few."

76561199015144202,2671060,False,0.956526696681976318,"Sadly, most of the content is badly designed RNG.

Personally i deem procedurally generated content to be a great way of increasing the variation and the longevity of content within a game.

However; if not enough care is taken to properly, and logically, integrate such content within a game this content can be very distracting, bad, and non-immersive.

The inclusion of legends could be grand for the game. To experience how your deeds not only influence the world, but also the tales told about your dynasty within it would be amazingly immersive. To see how bards, and sometimes you, twist truth into a more exciting form could be fun.

But sadly, legends fall under the category of badly procedurally generated content.

Take the following example:

My ruler was King Dumnarth of Cornwall. One of my favorite starts in 867, btw. It¬¥s fun to enter the fight for britain as a brythonic ruler.

King Dumnarth conquered the neighboring duchies of Wessex and Hwicce rather easily. And then, in a bid to increase his legitimacy and gather some prestige, he started spreading the legend that he and his line are descended from King Arthur.

While doing so Britanny was conquered by a norse Adventurer. King Dumnarth set sail in order to conquer free his bretic brethren from the Heathens. He won some great victories and drove them off, adding Britanny to his Demesne.

Then he proclaimed the Kingdom of Dumnonia. (Via the found a new kingdom decision, not the restore the kingdom of cornwall one.)

In gameplay terms this wasn¬¥t that much. In in-universe terms, though, this was something rather significant. A major victory against the Norse invaders was won and a new bretic kingdom, spanning the channel, formed.

This is the stuff of legends! What better to support his claim of descent from King Arthur, than to prove such undertakings!

However, it isn¬¥t reflected in the legend. At all.

The Legend fails in two ways, both the result of badly procedurally generated content. Content which is completely random, without being integrated in a sensible manner.

1.) It doesn¬¥t tie into the King Arthur myth at all. Arthur is mentioned once, but aside from this- nothing. It doesn¬¥t tie into this claim logically. A basic way this could, and has been done, would be to claim descent from him. Or to claim to have performed similiar feats. (Being visited by Merlin, finding excalibur, something.)

Instead the non-sensical claim of being birthed from a pool of blood and flesh is given. Yeah. Even though many people still alive in his kingdom will have known his parents. The same claim can be found in many other generated legends.

2.) It doesn¬¥t properly take into account which deeds of his have been noteworthy. I don¬¥t know how the selection works- If simply some deeds are eligible and some not, or if purely some random ones are chosen- But in this legend it didn¬¥t deign to mention his conquest of brittany and the victory over heathen invaders, nor does it mention the founding of a new kingdom.

Instead it chose to mention that one time he rode to some church, two baronies away from the border of his kingdom.

This isn¬¥t a fictionalised story of my character. This is [PICK RANDOM TEXT 1] + [PICK RANDOM TEXT 2] + [PICK RANDOM MEMORY FROM ROOT_CHARACTER].

Plagues and new disease mechanics: Mostly part of the free patch and  as far as I can tell basically lifted 1:1 from CK2 and the parts that are part of the DLC are sold back to players at an insane price, despite the assertions from Paradox that they were going to take time to put thought into new systems and mechanics to expand the game past what existed in CK2 - at least characters actually die now though this entire change now continues the trend of adding more and more costs to the game with no way to supplement income the game is still functioning on the basic economy system from CK2 a game that is almost 15 years old

Legitimacy: A shoehorned system that just adds further hoops to jump through to keep vassals in line seems mostly designed to encourage people to use the horrible and repetitive hold court feature from Royal Court the other horrible content release for CK3 - just another random stat you have to manage to keep people from rebelling ever few years and even when you do manage it the system only serves to force you to play in one way

[u]Bloodlines in CK2[/u]
Bloodlines were not only more dynamic but also more fun to collect. One of my favourite things to do in Ck2 was to consolidate bloodlines through intricate breeding projects. It needed planning, patience, determination and knowledge of different game mechanics. If you did not start with a bloodline you also had the option to set an ambition to create one. These created bloodlines could vary [b]wildly[/b], from peaceful ruler to bloodthirsty murderer and gave permanent modifiers that corresponded with the type of bloodline. There were in total [b]THIRTY+[/b] unique bloodlines the player could create. These were great for RP and gameplay. You could look back at your ancestor and go, ""Damn that guy that got the warrior lodge bloodline was a badass"" while also getting the prowess from being related to him. 

[u]Legends in CK3[/u]
Legends of the dead gives you [b]FOUR[/b] types of legends. Heroic, saint, legitimacy and an unofficial ancestor one. 
Heroic gives you claims, saint converts your realm and legitimacy gives you legitimacy and ancestor let's you revive a dead culture. That's the long and the short of it. You get extra things like a special building slot and an artefact which are ok. The legend is not permanent and costs 1/4 of your income over five years to produce. During these five years you have little to no impact of what the ""legend"" will actually say. 

Most of the time the legend will be filled with what feels like ChatGPT gibberish of plagues, bandits and local lords. As such the legend description with the exception of some will feel the same. Conquering Byzantium, mending the Schism, dismantling the Papacy and restoring Rome legends were nearly indistinguishable from each other in my run. People also seem to have the memory of goldfish, legends like King Arthur which have been passed down from 12th century to today are seemingly forgotten within decades. Legends like King Arthur are also known worldwide and feature in the pop culture of nations thousands of kilometres from Wales. In CK3 you'll be lucky if the peasants in Rome even know who restored the empire because the legend can only expand to 501 baronies.

Legends are character-specific (No Legends that define your dynasty like CK2 Bloodlines) and while they can be inherited, they are not inherited by your heir, rather your legend goes to a arbitrarily-assigned dynasty member and frankly, I have no clue how the game decides who gets it. That's assuming you die soon enough for it to be inherited, since most legends deactivate after a few decades. Apparently single-handily stopping a viking invasion stops mattering after 20 years, and nobody cares if your father unified England and claimed descent from King Arthur.

Legitimacy is a complete joke. It's character-specific, not title specific, so the game does not care about the scenario the devs themselves pointed out (Whether or not a French warrior-prince should be considered the rightful ruler of Byzantium), as long as you were legitimate in whatever title you had before, you're legitimate in all of them. 

Also a sudden UI revamp that, while not that bad honestly, came out of nowhere and they replaced all the click sounds with a very annoying ""Sword unsheathe, sword sheath"" sound that grates on you very quickly.

- Legends disappear after 20-something years after being made. They don't require any specific actions unlike they did in CK2, essentially you pay once, and then wait for the map to be painted with ''your legend is spreading''

- Legitimacy system in itself is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, you can have the same family ruling the kingdom/empire since the start of the game and some rulers will randomly start with legitimacy at max and others have it at maybe 1st or 2nd out of 5 levels.

Yet another DLC that adds new features that have a lot of promise, but needed significantly more development time to make them good. It seems like their business model these days is to create a barebones framework that the modders can finish for them.

I've played significantly more now and wow this DLC's new mechanics are a hot mess. I'll review it with the new free update.

1) Legitimacy. It's interesting, but not a single character starts with any levels of legitimacy, so the early game for everyone is just going to be a slog with needing to gain legitimacy

2) Diseases. oh diseases. This has been been something we have asked PDS to give us for several years now. It was a machochist's love from CK2, and now it's here, except now it's really annoying. diseases come every couple of years in random spots in the world, meaning if you're nearby any or you have a large empire, you're going to get event spammed with the same 3 events over and over and over again. the result from the events are never beneficial. they just happen. 

3) Legends. the big selling point and the thing actually on sale with this DLC is just ok. they're neat, but they are not spell/grammar checked at all, and are abusable. The AI will pursue legends, because why wouldn't you, and will often try to pay you to help spread the legend. but you spreading the legend costs gold per month to upkeep, so it really isn't worth your time much. so you can take their gold, and immediately stop promoting the legend. now if balance was a thing that existed, you might take a prestige hit, after all you just broke a deal? nope. maybe you lose some legitimacy, that cool new feature with this update? still no. ok, how about just an opinion hit? nope. It's free money, it's just free money. and that same character will try to pay you again a few months later, so we do the same thing again.
Legends spread from county to county based on who is spreading the legend and from a radius around where it originated, but there is a max to how far a legend can spread. The way it spreads is almost like a disease would spread, and that is probably why we got diseases in this update as well. Overall Legends are super underdeveloped and don't really add much to your gameplay

4) Funerals. Ah funerals the new activity you can do to gain legitimacy, lower stress, gain prestige, boost opinions, ... seduce someone, murder someone else. It's honestly a great activity. There's even an event during it where characters will reminisce on memories they have from the memories journal. except that characters don't generate memories of other characters at all, so the only thing they reminisce about them is when they declared war on them, slept with them, they died, or they killed them. most of the time they aren't even known as the killer. they just out themselves with a ""i killed him yeah""

This DLC is a super underdeveloped product and I genuinely cannot recommend this for $20. maybe try again when its on sale with a steep discount. and wait until it gets more patches to fix the glaring issues, which will probably never come."

For example when I spread the legend that my dynasty comes from the Huns, it should apply to my dynasty forever when I get it to mythical tier. But instead with this dlc, a legend only stays around for 100 years when you get it to mythical tier on the COUNTIES, not your dynasty. CK 2 did this much much better. No legend is permenant in this DLC. Legends should be completely permenant like how we know about King Arthur Pendragon to this day and how some dynasties in history claimed to be coming from them.

The Legends: A cool concept that give good rewards but are effectively a money sink. Range from a simple boost to development and skill boosts to ""you now have a claim to every independent title in Iberia"". The events around legends can be enjoyable but once you promote one legend to mythical status, you have seen all the events (and even your first time there can be repetition). My biggest complaint is that legends only last 20 years once completed, even though, especially if your pushing mythical, it can be a multi-generational effort, and unless you go all the way some of the rewards are RNG.

The dead: Imma be 100% funerals should have been part of the free update. The plagues are ok, adding to the chaos of the game and a more dynamic if intangible threat, and diseases are now actually scary at times. Havnt actually played long enough to see the black death so cant comment on it but from what I have seen from the community it seems pretty interesting, though you lose a absolute ton of development. Overall 7/10, you get whats on the tin.

Legitimacy: ok this is free update content but I need to rant somewhere, legitimacy is annoying. You lose way to much to plagues and losing a single battle but winning wars SOMETIMES give as much as back as losing a battle, but WINNING a battle outnumbered 3:1 does...nothing. Unless you do a legitimizing legend you can spend 50 years building up to level four, only for about 3-4 bad events in about the same amount of years knocks you to tier 3. And as for what tier is considered ""acceptable"" for your rank? Dont know, it bounced between 3-4 when I was a king, and always seemed to be where I was at least one level behind. Most of the advantages of high legitimacy are moot since unlike royal court each tier doesnt give benefits, only negates a penalty, while being over legitimacy is nigh impossible for kings who can actually make use of the bonuses like ""increased vassal acceptance chance"" but good luck maxing out the bar and keeping it for more then a year."

This DLC is a step back from the Bloodlines DLC from CK2 for the cost of the same price. Legends are limited, you can't even choose how to name your legend, it's always a random generic name tied to the legend unlocked and is not inherited by your dynasty, it's tied to counties which doesn't make sense since it's *your* legend, not the land's legend.

Legitimacy is a new mechanic tied to the legends feature, but you don't need the DLC to have this mechanic. If you are an usurper or startup ruler, you will have a slight struggle especially if your vassals are of different culture than you and your cultural acceptance is low. This mechanic adds a slight complexity on how vassals will accept your rule but overall not that impactful.

Plagues are another new mechanic added to the game which is basically also not that impactful since plague strength isn't that optimized even at full strength. You'll see ""casualties"" pertaining to the plague in question but it'll usually fizzle out before even killing 100 people, which is kinda underwhelming. I had to tell my court physician not to help with the plague so that I could actually experience the mechanic on my city. There are also no random events tied to plagues like not washing your hands after a hunt or falling into a latrine, causing a plague on your household if you have low learning, etc. Overall, plagues appear to be quite bland and just spams you with notifications of plagues that are just minor annoyances.

Let's get into fine details, shall we?

[h2]Plagues[/h2]

So, for the uninitiated, CK3 is a character-driven and focused RPG-meets-Sims game. Back when the game released 3 years ago, the design intent was to really invest into your characters, make them live long, have great education and congenital traits. The game really encouraged that with mechanics like Long/Short Reign, legacies like Octogenarians and Graceful Aging etc. However, a part of the community complained the game is not ""hardcore"" enough. As a result we got so called ""harm events"" in one of the updates, with the idea of randomly forcing death/crippling events on your characters and going completely against everything established previously. 

Plagues is the continuation of the trend. It adds the separate ""elderly heath"" stat to further cripple your characters beyond certain age, and otherwise all it does is randomly forces diseases on them. If previously my Rurik would live into his 60th - with this DLC he died in the early 50th from smallpox, and his son Helgi inherited at 27 and instantly got cancer. RIP. In the game where unplanned character death is akin to having your saves wiped it goes without saying how terrible these additions are. And the plagues are so constant that I eventually learned to live with them and ignore the constant buttons for ""Go into seclusion"" and ""Isolate the capital"" popping on my screen.

[h2]Legitimacy[/h2]

This mechanics is simple ""win more"" power creep that if you're a good player makes the game even easier and if you struggle makes it even worse for you. Win a few wars and do a feast and you notice it's easier to vassalize or make alliances. Lose a battle though, and you are hit with internal instability on top of that. Marry a beautiful lowborn girl and you're now hit with legitimacy penalty on top of the prestige one. The rising legitimacy expectations based on your rank are there to make it more difficult to keep kingdoms and empires together. However, this mechanics is superficial and in reality does little to change how the game is played. Like if you have the biggest army and the wealthiest domain around - you can pretty much forget legitimacy exists. 

[h2]Legends[/h2]

And this is a money sink. In the early game, maintaining and spreading a legend will cost you the money you could have spent on a large army, making it not really viable. And in the late game the rewards of the mechanics are pretty irrelevant. Imagine spending 3 legacy points to get a perk that grants your character a Saint trait, but you need to work for 100-200 years to complete a Mythic holy legend for it. The most important reward for legend completion are ""Legendary buildings"" - however those compete with existing Special buildings and Holy Sites for slots and end up being less powerful versions of those. This makes legends pointless if your domain is something like Paris or Rome, and while it could be useful if you want to make your domain in the middle of nowhere somewhat viable - you wouldn't have the funds to get it done in the first place. And the last reward is a book containing the legend (with random text which feels like written by ChatGPT) which only the character who completed the legend can commission for an additional sum of gold.

So there you have it - one mechanics that is harmful to the experience, one mechanics that is plain unnecessary, and one more that could be good if it wasn't half-baked and designed to be more than a money sink."

76561198114803179,2671060,True,0.648114025592803955,"Well. For me it is a decent addition. The additions of the Patch itself outweighs the addtitions of the DLC itself.

The pros are:

1) Plagues and Diseases are back. And they are a bit of fun.
2) It has some fun additions for Roleplaying purposes despite being more of a systemic pack.
3) The UI has gotten a lot better too. Espescially for some of the older mechanics as court positions.
4) While you could cheese Legitimacy and Legends it is more fun to let them run in a more role playing like style.

The cons are:

1) Legends could need more depth and there should be some more unique legends for many regions (Persia could need at least three more. Tibet also and why are things like the G√∂kturks not really a seed. I don't want to start with Africa).
2) Also there should be some ancestrial legends of your Dynasty in the late game.
3) The AI seems to have issues with legitimacy? I have the feel that they sometimes let it fall apart even with being able to avoid this situation.

For me it is a 7/10. It is not as good as Fate of Iberia or Tours and Tournaments and is a fine addition. Either get it in the Chaptr 3 Bundle or in a Sale as it is not amazing T&T or an all around good pack as Fate of Iberia.

But the best would be to wait for some patches that should come in a few days."

Otherwise legends(the paid portion) adds another layer to game play which is nice. However, for current players after a couple hours the gameplay isn't fun/unique enough to maintain engagement. I recommend buying it on sale or getting the bundle because Roads to Power seems like it will actually be great. 

Lastly, I swear the people who extol the virtues of CK2 bought it in the final year of development.

Granted, a fair share of the core returning plague mechanics are part of the free ""scythe"" update, only some extra elements and more expanded bits are part of the DLC pack related to the plague mechanics such as funerals, additional varieties in plagues, more fleshed out Black Death. 

However the 2nd focus those being legends which sounded like about the same what we had with bloodlines in CK2's final update fall kinda flat due one major issue, there is no way extend a legend , legends you create for your character and dynasti fade away in mere years which makes no sense, this is an issue that honestly can very easily be fixed by simply increasing somewhat how long a legend can exist and adding some simple additional mechanic in which future generation can keep the family legends going and have them always be inherited. 

Due to to the issue of the bizarrely short legends, a lot of people who unlike me maybe weren't mainly excited for the plagues but instead for the legends mechanic were let down thus , this has dropped to mixed reviews but since i am someone who primarily was excited and focused on the plagues returning, the legends stuff was more of an extra side thing for me so it didn't bum me out when it turned out it has this weird design flaw that i do hope will be fixed.

So due to this, i am still really happy, i was so excited to see dynamic plagues and diseases come back , though i would suggest waiting for a bit of a discount on this DLC, it's more worth it for like 15 bucks, maybe a tad less, i did get mine from a 3rd party store where they had a slight discount dropping it to 15 which felt more fair then these bizzare new awful prices they hiked up for CK3 DLC a year or so ago.

I think the plague mechanics are fine, though the base system was added to the main game for free, so really you're just paying for a few extra potential negative modifiers, names of plagues, and one RNG event chain. Legitimacy is pretty interesting as well and makes the game more challenging by giving you more penalties for trying to marry Genius peasants into your bloodline. But, once again legitimacy was added to the base game for free so it's not something you're paying for. They're starting to add ""Sub-tasks"" that your court positions like the Physician can do, which is great and gives the player more control over their court, but once again that's free with the base game.

So, if most of the major features of the DLC are actually free with the base game, what do you get here? A couple of RNG event chains, a handful of new clothes, the ability to hold funerals, and Legends. Legends feels like something thrown together at the last second to justify this being a major update and ""Major"" DLC instead of a major update and minor DLC. Through the mechanic of ""Legends"" players are now supposed to be able to create lasting legends for their dynasty that make you out to be a hero, legitimize your dynasty's right to rule, or turn you into a saint among men. That all sounds great on paper, but in reality Legends are little more than an RNG gold sink. You have no real power over what your legend is about, what deeds it promotes, or what the final story will be, in fact the final legend feels like chatGPT was fed every memory of my character and then forced to spit out the most mundane drivel it could think of. 
""Here's the legend of how kind Midas walked two counties over to visit a church."" Meanwhile in my lifetime I united an entire kingdom and drove out a massive plague. The rewards for creating a Legend include an ok artifact, and a ""Legendary"" building. These legendary buildings compete for existing duchy buildings and are generally simply on par with what you can already build though they do have some nice models for the buildings. 
To top it off legends are not a permanent thing despite all the effort that goes into building them. Depending on how much money and effort you sunk into a legend it will stick around for between 20 and 100 years. That's right, you can create a ""Legend"" and still be alive when everyone has forgotten all about it. King Arthur who? Saint Edward, never heard of him. Now, I could see legends needing upkeep if the rewards were truly powerful, and the need to erase or supersede a legend to create a new one, but the fact that they're called LEGENDS and are forgotten in less than a generation is terrible design and it makes it feel pretty bad creating them.
CK2 already did legends better, they were called bloodlines. The devs need to take a look back at what they already did and improve upon it instead of creating worse, less interesting features. 
I really can't recommend this DLC at $20, there's just not enough meat on the bone. Get it on a deep discount if you're really interested in it, but for me this ones a flop."

So the plague system is basically Reapers DLC from CK2; diseases and plagues are more deadly and have more consequences, which is excellent.

Unfortunately, the Legends system is poorly implemented; legends are costly to maintain yet do not last very long; aside from the most important legitimacy gain, there really isn't any reason to interact with the Legends system. 
As mentioned, Legends lasts a very short while after it's completed, and without dynastic interaction or any interaction with conquered land, the legends mechanic feels really hollow and shallow a system.

Legitimacy itself is also not anything interesting. Firstly, legitimacy gives buffs and debuffs, but does not affect the way claims are pushed if anything it feels more like short reign and long reign debuff and buff, respectively and feels redundant with the way it is implemented. 

Secondly the easiest way to gain legitimacy is through warfare, as other activities such as feasts, tours and weddinngs etc. are very costly. This now discourages play styles do not involve warfare, for example diplomacy and intrigue play styles will generate little to no legitimacy which almost guarantees that you will have to play the game with a major debuff.

 
Overall the legends and Legitimacy mechanic has a lot of potential and perhaps in the future there would be a touch up on this DLC to smooth out the implementation of the mechanics.

I‚Äôve had rulers that had their capital plagued 5 times before they even turned 40 years old, and i‚Äôve seen ireland turn into a desert with 0 development on the late start-date because they were hit near constantly by plagues with nothing to defend themselves.

Legitimacy has been the most awful thing i‚Äôve seen so far, where none of the already existing events and dialogues affect it at all, but the newly added funeral gives you absolute tons of it.

The legends are really quite stale. On top of that it's weird that you build up the legend yourself, as if a legend is some sort of ""top down"" thing in our world, rather than a story that gets passed around a community until it becomes something more than whatever event touched it off. I understand this is a video game, and that it is a representation of the world rather than a mirror of it, but this is so awkward and false in its execution, in its logic, that I cannot look past it. 

Legitimacy, a new mechanic meant to reflect how your community/realm views you, seems like a great idea at the start. Except there really was a mechanic for it already, in your relationship to individual characters. Legitimacy is, by a modern definition, the personal belief in the authority of a figure or an institution. Now instead of your character having a personal relationship with every other character, and that reflecting their individual loyalties to you as a ruler, their opinion is collated into a monolithic bar that you must seek to fill with video game points. 

Again, it is a reflection of a reality, rather than a mirror, but there was already a much better reflection in the game. One that was far more subtle. 

In truth this betrays an even greater problem with the game. What is the difference between authority and power? Power is the ability to make someone do something through threat of violence. Authority is the ability to command someone righteously. The Catholic Church, as portrayed in the game, is barely an entity. In reality, in the Middle Ages, it was the authoritative institution of the West. 

To have any legitimacy in a ruler, in a representation of the Christian West, the Church must be the authority to dispense that legitimacy. 

Feasts and hunts and fine robes do not a King make. Not in this place and this time period (or ever really). The authority of such things has to be lodged in something more than the material world. It has to come from a metaphysical ideal. In that regard, CK3 is like a scientific treatise. It proffers a neutral, sterilized view of the world in which the only recognized legitimacy at all is the ability and willingness to use violence to get what you want.

It happened to me and I am still mad about it.
Plagues are interesting, and definitely add a much needed threat for the player - but it still feels like it could have been better, and IMO outbreaks seem to be biased to happen in the player's territory, or at least in close proximity.

I doubt they actually implemented it. Could be a honest mistake, or could be an indicator for greater issues at Paradox.

Nope, the legend mentions how he visited Canterbury and some generic event where he is 'visited by god' which is actually just a 100 year old randomly generated lowborn character, it doesn't even get the details of the battle itself correct, Ottar had no reinforcements or aid from anybody, his snake-like Karling allies refusing to aid him in his noble quest for Christendom... yet it says here how the battle was nearly lost (which is correct until a battle roll went in his favour) until his horsemen (the only men at arms unit I hadn't invested in) smashed through the enemy Varangian heavy infantry... a unit that counters heavy horsemen.

The legends in short are painfully generic, nothing unique about them exists. All the origin legends detail about how you were born from a pool of Ragnarr Lothbrok or Arthur Pendragon's own 'flesh and blood'. Cool, until you see it again, and again, and again and then some more halfway across the world. These origin legends are pretty much exclusive to Europe too, nothing in Persia claiming to be from the ages of Darius, nothing in Greece about Alexander the GREAT, nothing about Genghis Khan after he falls, imagine how cool that would be? Nope.

To conclude, all the legends feel like they were written by chat GPT, nothing unique or interesting about them, to add insult to injury, Ottar's statue didn't even have his name on it, just generic flavour text about a ruler immortalized in stone. His legend faded and in 2 generations, the legendary ruler of the HRE, destroyer of heathens, incredible commander and wily as a hawk had faded into complete obscurity, the only reminder of his existence being a small statue in Cumberland with a popular opinion boost.

This DLC is a for sure buy when it is on SALE, otherwise, it has nothing of value to add to this game. I hope the next one is a bit better.

It really feels like a much, much worse version of bloodlines to me.

Legitimacy feels very poorly balanced and overall just punitive and removing of more player agency over their realm. Perhaps there can be a proper balancing of it but it really feels far more stick than carrot. The legitimacy hits from disinheriting for example are needlessly expensive, especially when it's having secondary children take the vows...

Disease meanwhile feels marginally less fleshed out than in CK2 reapers due, ESPECIALLY in terms of Hospitals and Plague vulnerability/resistance, the barony buildings really feel less enjoyable to engage with than Hospitals in CK2.

legends are the most half baked feature to come out of ck3 yet. even court artefact spamming has some level of interaction with it, but legends are truly awful. its start legend, wait for a bit, mindlessly click through event spam about it (I have seen the same event 4 separate times in the same playthrough for multiple events), click button to upgrade, repeat this step again, then click complete, get some generic bonuses or some region specific claims, and now you can never use this legend again for the rest of the game. 

that's right, in a game about dynastic succession, about seeing how each character's actions build onto each other, only one character in your entire dynasty can use a legend seed. according to this dlc, if Louis the stammerer claimed to be the decedent of Charlemagne, none of his line afterwards could EVER claim the same again. the biggest middle finger to the player? after all is said and done, and you complete your so called 'legend', not only does it die off the map completely in just a few decades, but you cant even read the chronicle. that's right, the devs who claim this is a role-playing game as an excuse for giving us barely any mechanics besides event spam for 3 years, have the main role-play feature of their new dlc straight up disappear from player view almost instantly.
 
the common sense way to do this is have legends actually affect your dynasty long term, and give them a set of standards to adhere too to appear more like their claimed ancestor. If you want people to see you as the heir of Charlemagne, defeat the Saracens in battle, have a group of famed knights who you ride into battle with, be crowned by the pope, defeat rebellious vassals, etc. if you fail at these things, people will see you as not living up to your claimed ancestry, giving worse penalties then failing these things normally. the worst part is that most of these issues cant be fixed by modding. I have looked into (and posted) a mod that tries to fix legends, but with how fundamentally flawed the system at its core, a mod can only put a bandied on the bullet wound.

plagues are pretty solid, if deadly (as they should be to an extent), but could have used a bit more depth which they could have gotten if resources were not wasted on the abysmal legends system. pretty self explanatory tbh, if you have played ck2, they are not too different

as for bugs, I have noticed some with the new sound effects (which im not a fan of compared to the old), and some bigger ones, like a random unlanded character occupying land for some inexplicable reason.

overall legends are awful, being yet another event spam coated with an unintuitive ui over it, and the additions the dlc gives to plagues are not worth it, as most of the new plague mechanics are base game. skip if you didn't buy chapter 3, and if you were like me and got blinded by byzantine empire and landless hype and instantly clicked buy on chapter 3, lets pray that they make up for this. ck3 cant (or rather shouldn't) survive another year of disappointments like the last few."

76561199015144202,2671060,False,0.956526696681976318,"Sadly, most of the content is badly designed RNG.

Personally i deem procedurally generated content to be a great way of increasing the variation and the longevity of content within a game.

However; if not enough care is taken to properly, and logically, integrate such content within a game this content can be very distracting, bad, and non-immersive.

The inclusion of legends could be grand for the game. To experience how your deeds not only influence the world, but also the tales told about your dynasty within it would be amazingly immersive. To see how bards, and sometimes you, twist truth into a more exciting form could be fun.

But sadly, legends fall under the category of badly procedurally generated content.

Take the following example:

My ruler was King Dumnarth of Cornwall. One of my favorite starts in 867, btw. It¬¥s fun to enter the fight for britain as a brythonic ruler.

King Dumnarth conquered the neighboring duchies of Wessex and Hwicce rather easily. And then, in a bid to increase his legitimacy and gather some prestige, he started spreading the legend that he and his line are descended from King Arthur.

While doing so Britanny was conquered by a norse Adventurer. King Dumnarth set sail in order to conquer free his bretic brethren from the Heathens. He won some great victories and drove them off, adding Britanny to his Demesne.

Then he proclaimed the Kingdom of Dumnonia. (Via the found a new kingdom decision, not the restore the kingdom of cornwall one.)

In gameplay terms this wasn¬¥t that much. In in-universe terms, though, this was something rather significant. A major victory against the Norse invaders was won and a new bretic kingdom, spanning the channel, formed.

This is the stuff of legends! What better to support his claim of descent from King Arthur, than to prove such undertakings!

However, it isn¬¥t reflected in the legend. At all.

The Legend fails in two ways, both the result of badly procedurally generated content. Content which is completely random, without being integrated in a sensible manner.

1.) It doesn¬¥t tie into the King Arthur myth at all. Arthur is mentioned once, but aside from this- nothing. It doesn¬¥t tie into this claim logically. A basic way this could, and has been done, would be to claim descent from him. Or to claim to have performed similiar feats. (Being visited by Merlin, finding excalibur, something.)

Instead the non-sensical claim of being birthed from a pool of blood and flesh is given. Yeah. Even though many people still alive in his kingdom will have known his parents. The same claim can be found in many other generated legends.

2.) It doesn¬¥t properly take into account which deeds of his have been noteworthy. I don¬¥t know how the selection works- If simply some deeds are eligible and some not, or if purely some random ones are chosen- But in this legend it didn¬¥t deign to mention his conquest of brittany and the victory over heathen invaders, nor does it mention the founding of a new kingdom.

Instead it chose to mention that one time he rode to some church, two baronies away from the border of his kingdom.

This isn¬¥t a fictionalised story of my character. This is [PICK RANDOM TEXT 1] + [PICK RANDOM TEXT 2] + [PICK RANDOM MEMORY FROM ROOT_CHARACTER].

Plagues and new disease mechanics: Mostly part of the free patch and  as far as I can tell basically lifted 1:1 from CK2 and the parts that are part of the DLC are sold back to players at an insane price, despite the assertions from Paradox that they were going to take time to put thought into new systems and mechanics to expand the game past what existed in CK2 - at least characters actually die now though this entire change now continues the trend of adding more and more costs to the game with no way to supplement income the game is still functioning on the basic economy system from CK2 a game that is almost 15 years old

Legitimacy: A shoehorned system that just adds further hoops to jump through to keep vassals in line seems mostly designed to encourage people to use the horrible and repetitive hold court feature from Royal Court the other horrible content release for CK3 - just another random stat you have to manage to keep people from rebelling ever few years and even when you do manage it the system only serves to force you to play in one way

[u]Bloodlines in CK2[/u]
Bloodlines were not only more dynamic but also more fun to collect. One of my favourite things to do in Ck2 was to consolidate bloodlines through intricate breeding projects. It needed planning, patience, determination and knowledge of different game mechanics. If you did not start with a bloodline you also had the option to set an ambition to create one. These created bloodlines could vary [b]wildly[/b], from peaceful ruler to bloodthirsty murderer and gave permanent modifiers that corresponded with the type of bloodline. There were in total [b]THIRTY+[/b] unique bloodlines the player could create. These were great for RP and gameplay. You could look back at your ancestor and go, ""Damn that guy that got the warrior lodge bloodline was a badass"" while also getting the prowess from being related to him. 

[u]Legends in CK3[/u]
Legends of the dead gives you [b]FOUR[/b] types of legends. Heroic, saint, legitimacy and an unofficial ancestor one. 
Heroic gives you claims, saint converts your realm and legitimacy gives you legitimacy and ancestor let's you revive a dead culture. That's the long and the short of it. You get extra things like a special building slot and an artefact which are ok. The legend is not permanent and costs 1/4 of your income over five years to produce. During these five years you have little to no impact of what the ""legend"" will actually say. 

Most of the time the legend will be filled with what feels like ChatGPT gibberish of plagues, bandits and local lords. As such the legend description with the exception of some will feel the same. Conquering Byzantium, mending the Schism, dismantling the Papacy and restoring Rome legends were nearly indistinguishable from each other in my run. People also seem to have the memory of goldfish, legends like King Arthur which have been passed down from 12th century to today are seemingly forgotten within decades. Legends like King Arthur are also known worldwide and feature in the pop culture of nations thousands of kilometres from Wales. In CK3 you'll be lucky if the peasants in Rome even know who restored the empire because the legend can only expand to 501 baronies.

The three extra ones and the black death are also part of this DLC I guess. They're fine but with all the difficulty settings set to max they're at most a nuisance.

Legends are character-specific (No Legends that define your dynasty like CK2 Bloodlines) and while they can be inherited, they are not inherited by your heir, rather your legend goes to a arbitrarily-assigned dynasty member and frankly, I have no clue how the game decides who gets it. That's assuming you die soon enough for it to be inherited, since most legends deactivate after a few decades. Apparently single-handily stopping a viking invasion stops mattering after 20 years, and nobody cares if your father unified England and claimed descent from King Arthur.

Legitimacy is a complete joke. It's character-specific, not title specific, so the game does not care about the scenario the devs themselves pointed out (Whether or not a French warrior-prince should be considered the rightful ruler of Byzantium), as long as you were legitimate in whatever title you had before, you're legitimate in all of them. 

Also a sudden UI revamp that, while not that bad honestly, came out of nowhere and they replaced all the click sounds with a very annoying ""Sword unsheathe, sword sheath"" sound that grates on you very quickly. Again, nothing like this was mentioned in the dev diaries and there is currently no way to change it.

There is also none of the flavor additions that CK2's Reaper's Due DLC gave, such as multiple execution methods.

Paradox keeps on missing. They had a solid base in CK2 and instead of refining it or adapting it for CK3, they decided to get ''creative''. What they came up with falls short of anything they promised in the trailers and dev blogs.

- Legends disappear after 20-something years after being made. They don't require any specific actions unlike they did in CK2, essentially you pay once, and then wait for the map to be painted with ''your legend is spreading''
- More than half of the events that are supposed to increase legitimacy don't work, I've tried different events: tours, feasts, weddings, funerals, so on. Only feasts had an actual even that actually increased legitimacy.
- Legitimacy system in itself is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, you can have the same family ruling the kingdom/empire since the start of the game and some rulers will randomly start with legitimacy at max and others have it at maybe 1st or 2nd out of 5 levels.
- Plagues are nothing more than a nuisance and money sink for rebuilding efforts, and that's it. You'll see constant pop-ups ''Isolate yourself/capital'' each time any plague shows up on the  map.

Yet another DLC that adds new features that have a lot of promise, but needed significantly more development time to make them good. It seems like their business model these days is to create a barebones framework that the modders can finish for them.

I've played significantly more now and wow this DLC's new mechanics are a hot mess. I'll review it with the new free update.

1) Legitimacy. It's interesting, but not a single character starts with any levels of legitimacy, so the early game for everyone is just going to be a slog with needing to gain legitimacy

2) Diseases. oh diseases. This has been been something we have asked PDS to give us for several years now. It was a machochist's love from CK2, and now it's here, except now it's really annoying. diseases come every couple of years in random spots in the world, meaning if you're nearby any or you have a large empire, you're going to get event spammed with the same 3 events over and over and over again. the result from the events are never beneficial. they just happen. 

3) Legends. the big selling point and the thing actually on sale with this DLC is just ok. they're neat, but they are not spell/grammar checked at all, and are abusable. The AI will pursue legends, because why wouldn't you, and will often try to pay you to help spread the legend. but you spreading the legend costs gold per month to upkeep, so it really isn't worth your time much. so you can take their gold, and immediately stop promoting the legend. now if balance was a thing that existed, you might take a prestige hit, after all you just broke a deal? nope. maybe you lose some legitimacy, that cool new feature with this update? still no. ok, how about just an opinion hit? nope. It's free money, it's just free money. and that same character will try to pay you again a few months later, so we do the same thing again.
Legends spread from county to county based on who is spreading the legend and from a radius around where it originated, but there is a max to how far a legend can spread. The way it spreads is almost like a disease would spread, and that is probably why we got diseases in this update as well. Overall Legends are super underdeveloped and don't really add much to your gameplay

4) Funerals. Ah funerals the new activity you can do to gain legitimacy, lower stress, gain prestige, boost opinions, ... seduce someone, murder someone else. It's honestly a great activity. There's even an event during it where characters will reminisce on memories they have from the memories journal. except that characters don't generate memories of other characters at all, so the only thing they reminisce about them is when they declared war on them, slept with them, they died, or they killed them. most of the time they aren't even known as the killer. they just out themselves with a ""i killed him yeah""

Firstly, the new 3D table is absolutely atrocious and unimmersive and there is no option to disable it, it feels like something that was just tacked on at the last second to grab more screenshots for the front page for more advertising. What I just pointed out also seems to be the policy for the entire DLC (and presumably every one to come after this one): Smoke and mirrors with no thought for gameplay or immersion.

Also congratulations to the Paradox Team for managing to fail to port the beloved Bloodlines Feature, instead replacing it with a Legends mechanic that is entirely inconsequential and feels like it was fabricated by ChatGPT in under an hour.

The Legends: A cool concept that give good rewards but are effectively a money sink. Range from a simple boost to development and skill boosts to ""you now have a claim to every independent title in Iberia"". The events around legends can be enjoyable but once you promote one legend to mythical status, you have seen all the events (and even your first time there can be repetition). My biggest complaint is that legends only last 20 years once completed, even though, especially if your pushing mythical, it can be a multi-generational effort, and unless you go all the way some of the rewards are RNG.

The dead: Imma be 100% funerals should have been part of the free update. The plagues are ok, adding to the chaos of the game and a more dynamic if intangible threat, and diseases are now actually scary at times. Havnt actually played long enough to see the black death so cant comment on it but from what I have seen from the community it seems pretty interesting, though you lose a absolute ton of development. Overall 7/10, you get whats on the tin.

Legitimacy: ok this is free update content but I need to rant somewhere, legitimacy is annoying. You lose way to much to plagues and losing a single battle but winning wars SOMETIMES give as much as back as losing a battle, but WINNING a battle outnumbered 3:1 does...nothing. Unless you do a legitimizing legend you can spend 50 years building up to level four, only for about 3-4 bad events in about the same amount of years knocks you to tier 3. And as for what tier is considered ""acceptable"" for your rank? Dont know, it bounced between 3-4 when I was a king, and always seemed to be where I was at least one level behind. Most of the advantages of high legitimacy are moot since unlike royal court each tier doesnt give benefits, only negates a penalty, while being over legitimacy is nigh impossible for kings who can actually make use of the bonuses like ""increased vassal acceptance chance"" but good luck maxing out the bar and keeping it for more then a year."

This DLC is a step back from the Bloodlines DLC from CK2 for the cost of the same price. Legends are limited, you can't even choose how to name your legend, it's always a random generic name tied to the legend unlocked and is not inherited by your dynasty, it's tied to counties which doesn't make sense since it's *your* legend, not the land's legend.

Legitimacy is a new mechanic tied to the legends feature, but you don't need the DLC to have this mechanic. If you are an usurper or startup ruler, you will have a slight struggle especially if your vassals are of different culture than you and your cultural acceptance is low. This mechanic adds a slight complexity on how vassals will accept your rule but overall not that impactful.

Plagues are another new mechanic added to the game which is basically also not that impactful since plague strength isn't that optimized even at full strength. You'll see ""casualties"" pertaining to the plague in question but it'll usually fizzle out before even killing 100 people, which is kinda underwhelming. I had to tell my court physician not to help with the plague so that I could actually experience the mechanic on my city. There are also no random events tied to plagues like not washing your hands after a hunt or falling into a latrine, causing a plague on your household if you have low learning, etc. Overall, plagues appear to be quite bland and just spams you with notifications of plagues that are just minor annoyances.

76561198075931333,2671060,False,0.655312597751617432,"Legends of the Dead proudly continues the tradition of pointless ""DLC for the sake of DLC"" for CK3, failing to polish or improve core gameplay but instead throwing in an array of features that are either stepping on the toes of existing mechanics, not making the experience better, or even making it worse. Let's get into fine details, shall we?

[h2]Plagues[/h2]

So, for the uninitiated, CK3 is a character-driven and focused RPG-meets-Sims game. Back when the game released 3 years ago, the design intent was to really invest into your characters, make them live long, have great education and congenital traits. The game really encouraged that with mechanics like Long/Short Reign, legacies like Octogenarians and Graceful Aging etc. However, a part of the community complained the game is not ""hardcore"" enough. As a result we got so called ""harm events"" in one of the updates, with the idea of randomly forcing death/crippling events on your characters and going completely against everything established previously. 

Plagues is the continuation of the trend. It adds the separate ""elderly heath"" stat to further cripple your characters beyond certain age, and otherwise all it does is randomly forces diseases on them. If previously my Rurik would live into his 60th - with this DLC he died in the early 50th from smallpox, and his son Helgi inherited at 27 and instantly got cancer. RIP. In the game where unplanned character death is akin to having your saves wiped it goes without saying how terrible these additions are. And the plagues are so constant that I eventually learned to live with them and ignore the constant buttons for ""Go into seclusion"" and ""Isolate the capital"" popping on my screen.

[h2]Legitimacy[/h2]

This mechanics is simple ""win more"" power creep that if you're a good player makes the game even easier and if you struggle makes it even worse for you. Win a few wars and do a feast and you notice it's easier to vassalize or make alliances. Lose a battle though, and you are hit with internal instability on top of that. Marry a beautiful lowborn girl and you're now hit with legitimacy penalty on top of the prestige one. The rising legitimacy expectations based on your rank are there to make it more difficult to keep kingdoms and empires together. However, this mechanics is superficial and in reality does little to change how the game is played. Like if you have the biggest army and the wealthiest domain around - you can pretty much forget legitimacy exists. 

[h2]Legends[/h2]

And this is a money sink. In the early game, maintaining and spreading a legend will cost you the money you could have spent on a large army, making it not really viable. And in the late game the rewards of the mechanics are pretty irrelevant. Imagine spending 3 legacy points to get a perk that grants your character a Saint trait, but you need to work for 100-200 years to complete a Mythic holy legend for it. The most important reward for legend completion are ""Legendary buildings"" - however those compete with existing Special buildings and Holy Sites for slots and end up being less powerful versions of those. This makes legends pointless if your domain is something like Paris or Rome, and while it could be useful if you want to make your domain in the middle of nowhere somewhat viable - you wouldn't have the funds to get it done in the first place. And the last reward is a book containing the legend (with random text which feels like written by ChatGPT) which only the character who completed the legend can commission for an additional sum of gold.

So there you have it - one mechanics that is harmful to the experience, one mechanics that is plain unnecessary, and one more that could be good if it wasn't half-baked and designed to be more than a money sink."

76561198114803179,2671060,True,0.648114025592803955,"Well. For me it is a decent addition. The additions of the Patch itself outweighs the addtitions of the DLC itself.

The pros are:

1) Plagues and Diseases are back. And they are a bit of fun.
2) It has some fun additions for Roleplaying purposes despite being more of a systemic pack.
3) The UI has gotten a lot better too. Espescially for some of the older mechanics as court positions.
4) While you could cheese Legitimacy and Legends it is more fun to let them run in a more role playing like style.

The cons are:

1) Legends could need more depth and there should be some more unique legends for many regions (Persia could need at least three more. Tibet also and why are things like the G√∂kturks not really a seed. I don't want to start with Africa).
2) Also there should be some ancestrial legends of your Dynasty in the late game.
3) The AI seems to have issues with legitimacy? I have the feel that they sometimes let it fall apart even with being able to avoid this situation.

For me it is a 7/10. It is not as good as Fate of Iberia or Tours and Tournaments and is a fine addition. Either get it in the Chaptr 3 Bundle or in a Sale as it is not amazing T&T or an all around good pack as Fate of Iberia.

Otherwise legends(the paid portion) adds another layer to game play which is nice. However, for current players after a couple hours the gameplay isn't fun/unique enough to maintain engagement. I recommend buying it on sale or getting the bundle because Roads to Power seems like it will actually be great. 

Lastly, I swear the people who extol the virtues of CK2 bought it in the final year of development.

I feel like they were trying to introduce plagues without the ""haha you randomly died"" since they got such a bad reception with that during their last expansions, however plagues is probably the only place it's actually warranted lol

Onto Legends and Legitimacy. Legends have almost no lasting effects on your family, some of them are really cool, some of the vikings get a ""legendary adventure"" which allows you to basically leave your kingdom and go somewhere else again which wraps up nicely with their wrath of the norsemen side.

Granted, a fair share of the core returning plague mechanics are part of the free ""scythe"" update, only some extra elements and more expanded bits are part of the DLC pack related to the plague mechanics such as funerals, additional varieties in plagues, more fleshed out Black Death. 

However the 2nd focus those being legends which sounded like about the same what we had with bloodlines in CK2's final update fall kinda flat due one major issue, there is no way extend a legend , legends you create for your character and dynasti fade away in mere years which makes no sense, this is an issue that honestly can very easily be fixed by simply increasing somewhat how long a legend can exist and adding some simple additional mechanic in which future generation can keep the family legends going and have them always be inherited. 

Due to to the issue of the bizarrely short legends, a lot of people who unlike me maybe weren't mainly excited for the plagues but instead for the legends mechanic were let down thus , this has dropped to mixed reviews but since i am someone who primarily was excited and focused on the plagues returning, the legends stuff was more of an extra side thing for me so it didn't bum me out when it turned out it has this weird design flaw that i do hope will be fixed.

So due to this, i am still really happy, i was so excited to see dynamic plagues and diseases come back , though i would suggest waiting for a bit of a discount on this DLC, it's more worth it for like 15 bucks, maybe a tad less, i did get mine from a 3rd party store where they had a slight discount dropping it to 15 which felt more fair then these bizzare new awful prices they hiked up for CK3 DLC a year or so ago.

I think the plague mechanics are fine, though the base system was added to the main game for free, so really you're just paying for a few extra potential negative modifiers, names of plagues, and one RNG event chain. Legitimacy is pretty interesting as well and makes the game more challenging by giving you more penalties for trying to marry Genius peasants into your bloodline. But, once again legitimacy was added to the base game for free so it's not something you're paying for. They're starting to add ""Sub-tasks"" that your court positions like the Physician can do, which is great and gives the player more control over their court, but once again that's free with the base game.

So, if most of the major features of the DLC are actually free with the base game, what do you get here? A couple of RNG event chains, a handful of new clothes, the ability to hold funerals, and Legends. Legends feels like something thrown together at the last second to justify this being a major update and ""Major"" DLC instead of a major update and minor DLC. Through the mechanic of ""Legends"" players are now supposed to be able to create lasting legends for their dynasty that make you out to be a hero, legitimize your dynasty's right to rule, or turn you into a saint among men. That all sounds great on paper, but in reality Legends are little more than an RNG gold sink. You have no real power over what your legend is about, what deeds it promotes, or what the final story will be, in fact the final legend feels like chatGPT was fed every memory of my character and then forced to spit out the most mundane drivel it could think of. 
""Here's the legend of how kind Midas walked two counties over to visit a church."" Meanwhile in my lifetime I united an entire kingdom and drove out a massive plague. The rewards for creating a Legend include an ok artifact, and a ""Legendary"" building. These legendary buildings compete for existing duchy buildings and are generally simply on par with what you can already build though they do have some nice models for the buildings. 
To top it off legends are not a permanent thing despite all the effort that goes into building them. Depending on how much money and effort you sunk into a legend it will stick around for between 20 and 100 years. That's right, you can create a ""Legend"" and still be alive when everyone has forgotten all about it. King Arthur who? Saint Edward, never heard of him. Now, I could see legends needing upkeep if the rewards were truly powerful, and the need to erase or supersede a legend to create a new one, but the fact that they're called LEGENDS and are forgotten in less than a generation is terrible design and it makes it feel pretty bad creating them.
CK2 already did legends better, they were called bloodlines. The devs need to take a look back at what they already did and improve upon it instead of creating worse, less interesting features.

Seeing my king create a legend at just 30 years old, only to see it totally disappear WHILE HE IS STILL ALIVE AND MAKING NEW CONQUESTS, sounds very stupid, doesn't it?

I must have gotten the Holy Touch Alms event well over 50 times by now, and on a few occasions I got this same event at least five times within seconds of each other.

It also breaks my immersion. There were plenty of ENDEMIC diseases in the Middle Ages, and as for epidemics the Black Death and its recurrences over the centuries are well-attested.

So the plague system is basically Reapers DLC from CK2; diseases and plagues are more deadly and have more consequences, which is excellent.

Unfortunately, the Legends system is poorly implemented; legends are costly to maintain yet do not last very long; aside from the most important legitimacy gain, there really isn't any reason to interact with the Legends system. 
As mentioned, Legends lasts a very short while after it's completed, and without dynastic interaction or any interaction with conquered land, the legends mechanic feels really hollow and shallow a system.

Legitimacy itself is also not anything interesting. Firstly, legitimacy gives buffs and debuffs, but does not affect the way claims are pushed if anything it feels more like short reign and long reign debuff and buff, respectively and feels redundant with the way it is implemented. 

Secondly the easiest way to gain legitimacy is through warfare, as other activities such as feasts, tours and weddinngs etc. are very costly. This now discourages play styles do not involve warfare, for example diplomacy and intrigue play styles will generate little to no legitimacy which almost guarantees that you will have to play the game with a major debuff.

 
Overall the legends and Legitimacy mechanic has a lot of potential and perhaps in the future there would be a touch up on this DLC to smooth out the implementation of the mechanics.

The plagues appear way too frequently and are always a death sentence to anyone who gets infected. I don‚Äôt understand why they couldn‚Äôt add smaller illnesses and coughs, and just went completely sadism-mode.
I‚Äôve had rulers that had their capital plagued 5 times before they even turned 40 years old, and i‚Äôve seen ireland turn into a desert with 0 development on the late start-date because they were hit near constantly by plagues with nothing to defend themselves.

Legitimacy has been the most awful thing i‚Äôve seen so far, where none of the already existing events and dialogues affect it at all, but the newly added funeral gives you absolute tons of it.
Why even hold feasts when you can marry an old lady and go to her funeral as soon as she dies. The whole system makes no sense anymore. And the fact that you getting his by plagues every week drops your legitimacy too fast for you to do anything anyways.

The legends are really quite stale. On top of that it's weird that you build up the legend yourself, as if a legend is some sort of ""top down"" thing in our world, rather than a story that gets passed around a community until it becomes something more than whatever event touched it off. I understand this is a video game, and that it is a representation of the world rather than a mirror of it, but this is so awkward and false in its execution, in its logic, that I cannot look past it. 

Legitimacy, a new mechanic meant to reflect how your community/realm views you, seems like a great idea at the start. Except there really was a mechanic for it already, in your relationship to individual characters. Legitimacy is, by a modern definition, the personal belief in the authority of a figure or an institution. Now instead of your character having a personal relationship with every other character, and that reflecting their individual loyalties to you as a ruler, their opinion is collated into a monolithic bar that you must seek to fill with video game points. 

Again, it is a reflection of a reality, rather than a mirror, but there was already a much better reflection in the game. One that was far more subtle. 

In truth this betrays an even greater problem with the game. What is the difference between authority and power? Power is the ability to make someone do something through threat of violence. Authority is the ability to command someone righteously. The Catholic Church, as portrayed in the game, is barely an entity. In reality, in the Middle Ages, it was the authoritative institution of the West. 

To have any legitimacy in a ruler, in a representation of the Christian West, the Church must be the authority to dispense that legitimacy. 

Feasts and hunts and fine robes do not a King make. Not in this place and this time period (or ever really). The authority of such things has to be lodged in something more than the material world. It has to come from a metaphysical ideal. In that regard, CK3 is like a scientific treatise. It proffers a neutral, sterilized view of the world in which the only recognized legitimacy at all is the ability and willingness to use violence to get what you want.

You are meant to get legitimacy by going to war and doing events but while between 0-100 you only sometimes get legitimacy going to war and about 10 for an event so good luck spamming feasts and hunts for 30 years and hope you can get out of the death spiral.
Finally the worst thing to come from this is certain starting character start with high legitimacy and so they have more power and they have the power to vassalize people even if those people are not de jure apart of their duchy or kingdom.

It happened to me and I am still mad about it.
Plagues are interesting, and definitely add a much needed threat for the player - but it still feels like it could have been better, and IMO outbreaks seem to be biased to happen in the player's territory, or at least in close proximity.
On top of that, full of bugs, and it's a shame that this is the expected standard by now from Paradox.

Also, minor detail, but, on release day, in the Developer Livestream there was a question from the community if Isolationist cultures get a bonus to plague resistance, which was affirmed by a Dev, but in the game, if this is true, there is no indicator for it in the cultural tradition. I doubt they actually implemented it. Could be a honest mistake, or could be an indicator for greater issues at Paradox.

I have tried to be as optimistic and fair as possible but I just cannot understand the praise this DLC gets from the community. Compare it to Bloodlines in CK2 and it's just a pure joke.

This DLC is not substandard, it is not terribly unbalanced or anything like that. It is simply... meh. Legends fade way too quickly, you would think the exalted among men emperor of the newly restored Roman Empire, who claims to be the son of a lynx and visited by god would be something remembered forever in the annuals of history? Nope, in about two generations literally everybody has forgotten about him- Not even a mention of his name. The legends are generic too which really doesn't help the situation. The best example of this is Ottar ""Die Vogel"" of house Babenberger, a legendary ruler who restored the Holy Roman Empire from a mere county in Wien, destroying his enemies and launching grand holy wars into England, overrun by heathens. 

This sounds awesome right? Something mentioned in his legend ""Battle of Cumberland"" the battle which decided the fate of Scotland, England and Ireland? Nope, the legend mentions how he visited Canterbury and some generic event where he is 'visited by god' which is actually just a 100 year old randomly generated lowborn character, it doesn't even get the details of the battle itself correct, Ottar had no reinforcements or aid from anybody, his snake-like Karling allies refusing to aid him in his noble quest for Christendom... yet it says here how the battle was nearly lost (which is correct until a battle roll went in his favour) until his horsemen (the only men at arms unit I hadn't invested in) smashed through the enemy Varangian heavy infantry... a unit that counters heavy horsemen.

The legends in short are painfully generic, nothing unique about them exists. All the origin legends detail about how you were born from a pool of Ragnarr Lothbrok or Arthur Pendragon's own 'flesh and blood'. Cool, until you see it again, and again, and again and then some more halfway across the world. These origin legends are pretty much exclusive to Europe too, nothing in Persia claiming to be from the ages of Darius, nothing in Greece about Alexander the GREAT, nothing about Genghis Khan after he falls, imagine how cool that would be? Nope.

To conclude, all the legends feel like they were written by chat GPT, nothing unique or interesting about them, to add insult to injury, Ottar's statue didn't even have his name on it, just generic flavour text about a ruler immortalized in stone. His legend faded and in 2 generations, the legendary ruler of the HRE, destroyer of heathens, incredible commander and wily as a hawk had faded into complete obscurity, the only reminder of his existence being a small statue in Cumberland with a popular opinion boost.

Legitimacy feels very poorly balanced and overall just punitive and removing of more player agency over their realm. Perhaps there can be a proper balancing of it but it really feels far more stick than carrot. The legitimacy hits from disinheriting for example are needlessly expensive, especially when it's having secondary children take the vows...

Disease meanwhile feels marginally less fleshed out than in CK2 reapers due, ESPECIALLY in terms of Hospitals and Plague vulnerability/resistance, the barony buildings really feel less enjoyable to engage with than Hospitals in CK2.

legends are the most half baked feature to come out of ck3 yet. even court artefact spamming has some level of interaction with it, but legends are truly awful. its start legend, wait for a bit, mindlessly click through event spam about it (I have seen the same event 4 separate times in the same playthrough for multiple events), click button to upgrade, repeat this step again, then click complete, get some generic bonuses or some region specific claims, and now you can never use this legend again for the rest of the game. 

that's right, in a game about dynastic succession, about seeing how each character's actions build onto each other, only one character in your entire dynasty can use a legend seed. according to this dlc, if Louis the stammerer claimed to be the decedent of Charlemagne, none of his line afterwards could EVER claim the same again. the biggest middle finger to the player? after all is said and done, and you complete your so called 'legend', not only does it die off the map completely in just a few decades, but you cant even read the chronicle. that's right, the devs who claim this is a role-playing game as an excuse for giving us barely any mechanics besides event spam for 3 years, have the main role-play feature of their new dlc straight up disappear from player view almost instantly.
 
the common sense way to do this is have legends actually affect your dynasty long term, and give them a set of standards to adhere too to appear more like their claimed ancestor. If you want people to see you as the heir of Charlemagne, defeat the Saracens in battle, have a group of famed knights who you ride into battle with, be crowned by the pope, defeat rebellious vassals, etc. if you fail at these things, people will see you as not living up to your claimed ancestry, giving worse penalties then failing these things normally. the worst part is that most of these issues cant be fixed by modding. I have looked into (and posted) a mod that tries to fix legends, but with how fundamentally flawed the system at its core, a mod can only put a bandied on the bullet wound.

plagues are pretty solid, if deadly (as they should be to an extent), but could have used a bit more depth which they could have gotten if resources were not wasted on the abysmal legends system. pretty self explanatory tbh, if you have played ck2, they are not too different

overall legends are awful, being yet another event spam coated with an unintuitive ui over it, and the additions the dlc gives to plagues are not worth it, as most of the new plague mechanics are base game. skip if you didn't buy chapter 3, and if you were like me and got blinded by byzantine empire and landless hype and instantly clicked buy on chapter 3, lets pray that they make up for this. ck3 cant (or rather shouldn't) survive another year of disappointments like the last few."

76561199015144202,2671060,False,0.956526696681976318,"Sadly, most of the content is badly designed RNG.

Personally i deem procedurally generated content to be a great way of increasing the variation and the longevity of content within a game.

However; if not enough care is taken to properly, and logically, integrate such content within a game this content can be very distracting, bad, and non-immersive.

The inclusion of legends could be grand for the game. To experience how your deeds not only influence the world, but also the tales told about your dynasty within it would be amazingly immersive. To see how bards, and sometimes you, twist truth into a more exciting form could be fun.

But sadly, legends fall under the category of badly procedurally generated content.

Take the following example:

My ruler was King Dumnarth of Cornwall. One of my favorite starts in 867, btw. It¬¥s fun to enter the fight for britain as a brythonic ruler.

King Dumnarth conquered the neighboring duchies of Wessex and Hwicce rather easily. And then, in a bid to increase his legitimacy and gather some prestige, he started spreading the legend that he and his line are descended from King Arthur.

While doing so Britanny was conquered by a norse Adventurer. King Dumnarth set sail in order to conquer free his bretic brethren from the Heathens. He won some great victories and drove them off, adding Britanny to his Demesne.

Then he proclaimed the Kingdom of Dumnonia. (Via the found a new kingdom decision, not the restore the kingdom of cornwall one.)

In gameplay terms this wasn¬¥t that much. In in-universe terms, though, this was something rather significant. A major victory against the Norse invaders was won and a new bretic kingdom, spanning the channel, formed.

This is the stuff of legends! What better to support his claim of descent from King Arthur, than to prove such undertakings!

However, it isn¬¥t reflected in the legend. At all.

The Legend fails in two ways, both the result of badly procedurally generated content. Content which is completely random, without being integrated in a sensible manner.

1.) It doesn¬¥t tie into the King Arthur myth at all. Arthur is mentioned once, but aside from this- nothing. It doesn¬¥t tie into this claim logically. A basic way this could, and has been done, would be to claim descent from him. Or to claim to have performed similiar feats. (Being visited by Merlin, finding excalibur, something.)

Instead the non-sensical claim of being birthed from a pool of blood and flesh is given. Yeah. Even though many people still alive in his kingdom will have known his parents. The same claim can be found in many other generated legends.

2.) It doesn¬¥t properly take into account which deeds of his have been noteworthy. I don¬¥t know how the selection works- If simply some deeds are eligible and some not, or if purely some random ones are chosen- But in this legend it didn¬¥t deign to mention his conquest of brittany and the victory over heathen invaders, nor does it mention the founding of a new kingdom.

Instead it chose to mention that one time he rode to some church, two baronies away from the border of his kingdom.

This isn¬¥t a fictionalised story of my character. This is [PICK RANDOM TEXT 1] + [PICK RANDOM TEXT 2] + [PICK RANDOM MEMORY FROM ROOT_CHARACTER].

Plagues and new disease mechanics: Mostly part of the free patch and  as far as I can tell basically lifted 1:1 from CK2 and the parts that are part of the DLC are sold back to players at an insane price, despite the assertions from Paradox that they were going to take time to put thought into new systems and mechanics to expand the game past what existed in CK2 - at least characters actually die now though this entire change now continues the trend of adding more and more costs to the game with no way to supplement income the game is still functioning on the basic economy system from CK2 a game that is almost 15 years old

Legitimacy: A shoehorned system that just adds further hoops to jump through to keep vassals in line seems mostly designed to encourage people to use the horrible and repetitive hold court feature from Royal Court the other horrible content release for CK3 - just another random stat you have to manage to keep people from rebelling ever few years and even when you do manage it the system only serves to force you to play in one way

Funerals: 3 years into a game all about playing individual rulers, managing a family and eventually dying to only now be getting funerals (who knows when coronations, accessions or investiture ceremonies will be added but I won't hold my breath)

[u]Bloodlines in CK2[/u]
Bloodlines were not only more dynamic but also more fun to collect. One of my favourite things to do in Ck2 was to consolidate bloodlines through intricate breeding projects. It needed planning, patience, determination and knowledge of different game mechanics. If you did not start with a bloodline you also had the option to set an ambition to create one. These created bloodlines could vary [b]wildly[/b], from peaceful ruler to bloodthirsty murderer and gave permanent modifiers that corresponded with the type of bloodline. There were in total [b]THIRTY+[/b] unique bloodlines the player could create. These were great for RP and gameplay. You could look back at your ancestor and go, ""Damn that guy that got the warrior lodge bloodline was a badass"" while also getting the prowess from being related to him. 

[u]Legends in CK3[/u]
Legends of the dead gives you [b]FOUR[/b] types of legends. Heroic, saint, legitimacy and an unofficial ancestor one. 
Heroic gives you claims, saint converts your realm and legitimacy gives you legitimacy and ancestor let's you revive a dead culture. That's the long and the short of it. You get extra things like a special building slot and an artefact which are ok. The legend is not permanent and costs 1/4 of your income over five years to produce. During these five years you have little to no impact of what the ""legend"" will actually say. 

Most of the time the legend will be filled with what feels like ChatGPT gibberish of plagues, bandits and local lords. As such the legend description with the exception of some will feel the same. Conquering Byzantium, mending the Schism, dismantling the Papacy and restoring Rome legends were nearly indistinguishable from each other in my run. People also seem to have the memory of goldfish, legends like King Arthur which have been passed down from 12th century to today are seemingly forgotten within decades. Legends like King Arthur are also known worldwide and feature in the pop culture of nations thousands of kilometres from Wales. In CK3 you'll be lucky if the peasants in Rome even know who restored the empire because the legend can only expand to 501 baronies.

[u]Plagues[/u]
The three extra ones and the black death are also part of this DLC I guess. They're fine but with all the difficulty settings set to max they're at most a nuisance.

Legends are character-specific (No Legends that define your dynasty like CK2 Bloodlines) and while they can be inherited, they are not inherited by your heir, rather your legend goes to a arbitrarily-assigned dynasty member and frankly, I have no clue how the game decides who gets it. That's assuming you die soon enough for it to be inherited, since most legends deactivate after a few decades. Apparently single-handily stopping a viking invasion stops mattering after 20 years, and nobody cares if your father unified England and claimed descent from King Arthur.

Legitimacy is a complete joke. It's character-specific, not title specific, so the game does not care about the scenario the devs themselves pointed out (Whether or not a French warrior-prince should be considered the rightful ruler of Byzantium), as long as you were legitimate in whatever title you had before, you're legitimate in all of them. 

Also a sudden UI revamp that, while not that bad honestly, came out of nowhere and they replaced all the click sounds with a very annoying ""Sword unsheathe, sword sheath"" sound that grates on you very quickly. Again, nothing like this was mentioned in the dev diaries and there is currently no way to change it.

There is also none of the flavor additions that CK2's Reaper's Due DLC gave, such as multiple execution methods.

Paradox keeps on missing. They had a solid base in CK2 and instead of refining it or adapting it for CK3, they decided to get ''creative''. What they came up with falls short of anything they promised in the trailers and dev blogs.

- Legends disappear after 20-something years after being made. They don't require any specific actions unlike they did in CK2, essentially you pay once, and then wait for the map to be painted with ''your legend is spreading''
- More than half of the events that are supposed to increase legitimacy don't work, I've tried different events: tours, feasts, weddings, funerals, so on. Only feasts had an actual even that actually increased legitimacy.
- Legitimacy system in itself is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, you can have the same family ruling the kingdom/empire since the start of the game and some rulers will randomly start with legitimacy at max and others have it at maybe 1st or 2nd out of 5 levels.
- Plagues are nothing more than a nuisance and money sink for rebuilding efforts, and that's it. You'll see constant pop-ups ''Isolate yourself/capital'' each time any plague shows up on the  map. (A simple fix to that would be to make this option become an event ONLY when the plague reaches your personal domain - Paradox, take notes)"

Yet another DLC that adds new features that have a lot of promise, but needed significantly more development time to make them good. It seems like their business model these days is to create a barebones framework that the modders can finish for them.

I've played significantly more now and wow this DLC's new mechanics are a hot mess. I'll review it with the new free update.

1) Legitimacy. It's interesting, but not a single character starts with any levels of legitimacy, so the early game for everyone is just going to be a slog with needing to gain legitimacy

2) Diseases. oh diseases. This has been been something we have asked PDS to give us for several years now. It was a machochist's love from CK2, and now it's here, except now it's really annoying. diseases come every couple of years in random spots in the world, meaning if you're nearby any or you have a large empire, you're going to get event spammed with the same 3 events over and over and over again. the result from the events are never beneficial. they just happen. 

3) Legends. the big selling point and the thing actually on sale with this DLC is just ok. they're neat, but they are not spell/grammar checked at all, and are abusable. The AI will pursue legends, because why wouldn't you, and will often try to pay you to help spread the legend. but you spreading the legend costs gold per month to upkeep, so it really isn't worth your time much. so you can take their gold, and immediately stop promoting the legend. now if balance was a thing that existed, you might take a prestige hit, after all you just broke a deal? nope. maybe you lose some legitimacy, that cool new feature with this update? still no. ok, how about just an opinion hit? nope. It's free money, it's just free money. and that same character will try to pay you again a few months later, so we do the same thing again.
Legends spread from county to county based on who is spreading the legend and from a radius around where it originated, but there is a max to how far a legend can spread. The way it spreads is almost like a disease would spread, and that is probably why we got diseases in this update as well. Overall Legends are super underdeveloped and don't really add much to your gameplay

4) Funerals. Ah funerals the new activity you can do to gain legitimacy, lower stress, gain prestige, boost opinions, ... seduce someone, murder someone else. It's honestly a great activity. There's even an event during it where characters will reminisce on memories they have from the memories journal. except that characters don't generate memories of other characters at all, so the only thing they reminisce about them is when they declared war on them, slept with them, they died, or they killed them. most of the time they aren't even known as the killer. they just out themselves with a ""i killed him yeah""

This DLC is a super underdeveloped product and I genuinely cannot recommend this for $20. maybe try again when its on sale with a steep discount. and wait until it gets more patches to fix the glaring issues, which will probably never come."

The Legends: A cool concept that give good rewards but are effectively a money sink. Range from a simple boost to development and skill boosts to ""you now have a claim to every independent title in Iberia"". The events around legends can be enjoyable but once you promote one legend to mythical status, you have seen all the events (and even your first time there can be repetition). My biggest complaint is that legends only last 20 years once completed, even though, especially if your pushing mythical, it can be a multi-generational effort, and unless you go all the way some of the rewards are RNG.

The dead: Imma be 100% funerals should have been part of the free update.

Overall 7/10, you get whats on the tin.

Legitimacy: ok this is free update content but I need to rant somewhere, legitimacy is annoying. You lose way to much to plagues and losing a single battle but winning wars SOMETIMES give as much as back as losing a battle, but WINNING a battle outnumbered 3:1 does...nothing. Unless you do a legitimizing legend you can spend 50 years building up to level four, only for about 3-4 bad events in about the same amount of years knocks you to tier 3. And as for what tier is considered ""acceptable"" for your rank? Dont know, it bounced between 3-4 when I was a king, and always seemed to be where I was at least one level behind. Most of the advantages of high legitimacy are moot since unlike royal court each tier doesnt give benefits, only negates a penalty, while being over legitimacy is nigh impossible for kings who can actually make use of the bonuses like ""increased vassal acceptance chance"" but good luck maxing out the bar and keeping it for more then a year."

Legitimacy is a new mechanic tied to the legends feature, but you don't need the DLC to have this mechanic. If you are an usurper or startup ruler, you will have a slight struggle especially if your vassals are of different culture than you and your cultural acceptance is low. This mechanic adds a slight complexity on how vassals will accept your rule but overall not that impactful.

Plagues are another new mechanic added to the game which is basically also not that impactful since plague strength isn't that optimized even at full strength. You'll see ""casualties"" pertaining to the plague in question but it'll usually fizzle out before even killing 100 people, which is kinda underwhelming. I had to tell my court physician not to help with the plague so that I could actually experience the mechanic on my city.

So, for the uninitiated, CK3 is a character-driven and focused RPG-meets-Sims game. Back when the game released 3 years ago, the design intent was to really invest into your characters, make them live long, have great education and congenital traits. The game really encouraged that with mechanics like Long/Short Reign, legacies like Octogenarians and Graceful Aging etc. However, a part of the community complained the game is not ""hardcore"" enough. As a result we got so called ""harm events"" in one of the updates, with the idea of randomly forcing death/crippling events on your characters and going completely against everything established previously. 

Plagues is the continuation of the trend. It adds the separate ""elderly heath"" stat to further cripple your characters beyond certain age, and otherwise all it does is randomly forces diseases on them. If previously my Rurik would live into his 60th - with this DLC he died in the early 50th from smallpox, and his son Helgi inherited at 27 and instantly got cancer. RIP. In the game where unplanned character death is akin to having your saves wiped it goes without saying how terrible these additions are. And the plagues are so constant that I eventually learned to live with them and ignore the constant buttons for ""Go into seclusion"" and ""Isolate the capital"" popping on my screen.

[h2]Legitimacy[/h2]

This mechanics is simple ""win more"" power creep that if you're a good player makes the game even easier and if you struggle makes it even worse for you. Win a few wars and do a feast and you notice it's easier to vassalize or make alliances. Lose a battle though, and you are hit with internal instability on top of that. Marry a beautiful lowborn girl and you're now hit with legitimacy penalty on top of the prestige one. The rising legitimacy expectations based on your rank are there to make it more difficult to keep kingdoms and empires together. However, this mechanics is superficial and in reality does little to change how the game is played. Like if you have the biggest army and the wealthiest domain around - you can pretty much forget legitimacy exists. 

[h2]Legends[/h2]

And this is a money sink. In the early game, maintaining and spreading a legend will cost you the money you could have spent on a large army, making it not really viable. And in the late game the rewards of the mechanics are pretty irrelevant. Imagine spending 3 legacy points to get a perk that grants your character a Saint trait, but you need to work for 100-200 years to complete a Mythic holy legend for it. The most important reward for legend completion are ""Legendary buildings"" - however those compete with existing Special buildings and Holy Sites for slots and end up being less powerful versions of those. This makes legends pointless if your domain is something like Paris or Rome, and while it could be useful if you want to make your domain in the middle of nowhere somewhat viable - you wouldn't have the funds to get it done in the first place. And the last reward is a book containing the legend (with random text which feels like written by ChatGPT) which only the character who completed the legend can commission for an additional sum of gold.

So there you have it - one mechanics that is harmful to the experience, one mechanics that is plain unnecessary, and one more that could be good if it wasn't half-baked and designed to be more than a money sink."

76561198114803179,2671060,True,0.648114025592803955,"Well. For me it is a decent addition. The additions of the Patch itself outweighs the addtitions of the DLC itself.

The pros are:

1) Plagues and Diseases are back. And they are a bit of fun.
2) It has some fun additions for Roleplaying purposes despite being more of a systemic pack.
3) The UI has gotten a lot better too. Espescially for some of the older mechanics as court positions.
4) While you could cheese Legitimacy and Legends it is more fun to let them run in a more role playing like style.

The cons are:

1) Legends could need more depth and there should be some more unique legends for many regions (Persia could need at least three more. Tibet also and why are things like the G√∂kturks not really a seed. I don't want to start with Africa).
2) Also there should be some ancestrial legends of your Dynasty in the late game.
3) The AI seems to have issues with legitimacy? I have the feel that they sometimes let it fall apart even with being able to avoid this situation.

For me it is a 7/10. It is not as good as Fate of Iberia or Tours and Tournaments and is a fine addition. Either get it in the Chaptr 3 Bundle or in a Sale as it is not amazing T&T or an all around good pack as Fate of Iberia.

I feel like they were trying to introduce plagues without the ""haha you randomly died"" since they got such a bad reception with that during their last expansions, however plagues is probably the only place it's actually warranted lol

Granted, a fair share of the core returning plague mechanics are part of the free ""scythe"" update, only some extra elements and more expanded bits are part of the DLC pack related to the plague mechanics such as funerals, additional varieties in plagues, more fleshed out Black Death. 

However the 2nd focus those being legends which sounded like about the same what we had with bloodlines in CK2's final update fall kinda flat due one major issue, there is no way extend a legend , legends you create for your character and dynasti fade away in mere years which makes no sense, this is an issue that honestly can very easily be fixed by simply increasing somewhat how long a legend can exist and adding some simple additional mechanic in which future generation can keep the family legends going and have them always be inherited. 

Due to to the issue of the bizarrely short legends, a lot of people who unlike me maybe weren't mainly excited for the plagues but instead for the legends mechanic were let down thus , this has dropped to mixed reviews but since i am someone who primarily was excited and focused on the plagues returning, the legends stuff was more of an extra side thing for me so it didn't bum me out when it turned out it has this weird design flaw that i do hope will be fixed.

So due to this, i am still really happy, i was so excited to see dynamic plagues and diseases come back , though i would suggest waiting for a bit of a discount on this DLC, it's more worth it for like 15 bucks, maybe a tad less, i did get mine from a 3rd party store where they had a slight discount dropping it to 15 which felt more fair then these bizzare new awful prices they hiked up for CK3 DLC a year or so ago.

76561198040005911,2671060,False,0.593146085739135742,"Painfully unimpressed by this one. I think the plague mechanics are fine, though the base system was added to the main game for free, so really you're just paying for a few extra potential negative modifiers, names of plagues, and one RNG event chain. Legitimacy is pretty interesting as well and makes the game more challenging by giving you more penalties for trying to marry Genius peasants into your bloodline. But, once again legitimacy was added to the base game for free so it's not something you're paying for. They're starting to add ""Sub-tasks"" that your court positions like the Physician can do, which is great and gives the player more control over their court, but once again that's free with the base game.

So, if most of the major features of the DLC are actually free with the base game, what do you get here? A couple of RNG event chains, a handful of new clothes, the ability to hold funerals, and Legends. Legends feels like something thrown together at the last second to justify this being a major update and ""Major"" DLC instead of a major update and minor DLC. Through the mechanic of ""Legends"" players are now supposed to be able to create lasting legends for their dynasty that make you out to be a hero, legitimize your dynasty's right to rule, or turn you into a saint among men. That all sounds great on paper, but in reality Legends are little more than an RNG gold sink. You have no real power over what your legend is about, what deeds it promotes, or what the final story will be, in fact the final legend feels like chatGPT was fed every memory of my character and then forced to spit out the most mundane drivel it could think of. 
""Here's the legend of how kind Midas walked two counties over to visit a church."" Meanwhile in my lifetime I united an entire kingdom and drove out a massive plague. The rewards for creating a Legend include an ok artifact, and a ""Legendary"" building. These legendary buildings compete for existing duchy buildings and are generally simply on par with what you can already build though they do have some nice models for the buildings. 
To top it off legends are not a permanent thing despite all the effort that goes into building them. Depending on how much money and effort you sunk into a legend it will stick around for between 20 and 100 years. That's right, you can create a ""Legend"" and still be alive when everyone has forgotten all about it. King Arthur who? Saint Edward, never heard of him. Now, I could see legends needing upkeep if the rewards were truly powerful, and the need to erase or supersede a legend to create a new one, but the fact that they're called LEGENDS and are forgotten in less than a generation is terrible design and it makes it feel pretty bad creating them.
CK2 already did legends better, they were called bloodlines. The devs need to take a look back at what they already did and improve upon it instead of creating worse, less interesting features.

Seeing my king create a legend at just 30 years old, only to see it totally disappear WHILE HE IS STILL ALIVE AND MAKING NEW CONQUESTS, sounds very stupid, doesn't it?

I hope that the community's comments will be listened to and that this problem will be solved, if not by Paradox then at least by the community itself (thanks to all the modders out there btw, you truly are the best that mankind can offer) which would save us again from a mechanic created and promptly abandoned.

So the plague system is basically Reapers DLC from CK2; diseases and plagues are more deadly and have more consequences, which is excellent.

Unfortunately, the Legends system is poorly implemented; legends are costly to maintain yet do not last very long; aside from the most important legitimacy gain, there really isn't any reason to interact with the Legends system. 
As mentioned, Legends lasts a very short while after it's completed, and without dynastic interaction or any interaction with conquered land, the legends mechanic feels really hollow and shallow a system.

Legitimacy itself is also not anything interesting. Firstly, legitimacy gives buffs and debuffs, but does not affect the way claims are pushed if anything it feels more like short reign and long reign debuff and buff, respectively and feels redundant with the way it is implemented. 

Secondly the easiest way to gain legitimacy is through warfare, as other activities such as feasts, tours and weddinngs etc. are very costly. This now discourages play styles do not involve warfare, for example diplomacy and intrigue play styles will generate little to no legitimacy which almost guarantees that you will have to play the game with a major debuff.

 
Overall the legends and Legitimacy mechanic has a lot of potential and perhaps in the future there would be a touch up on this DLC to smooth out the implementation of the mechanics.

The plagues appear way too frequently and are always a death sentence to anyone who gets infected. I don‚Äôt understand why they couldn‚Äôt add smaller illnesses and coughs, and just went completely sadism-mode.
I‚Äôve had rulers that had their capital plagued 5 times before they even turned 40 years old, and i‚Äôve seen ireland turn into a desert with 0 development on the late start-date because they were hit near constantly by plagues with nothing to defend themselves.

Legitimacy has been the most awful thing i‚Äôve seen so far, where none of the already existing events and dialogues affect it at all, but the newly added funeral gives you absolute tons of it.
Why even hold feasts when you can marry an old lady and go to her funeral as soon as she dies. The whole system makes no sense anymore. And the fact that you getting his by plagues every week drops your legitimacy too fast for you to do anything anyways.

The legends are really quite stale. On top of that it's weird that you build up the legend yourself, as if a legend is some sort of ""top down"" thing in our world, rather than a story that gets passed around a community until it becomes something more than whatever event touched it off. I understand this is a video game, and that it is a representation of the world rather than a mirror of it, but this is so awkward and false in its execution, in its logic, that I cannot look past it. 

Legitimacy, a new mechanic meant to reflect how your community/realm views you, seems like a great idea at the start. Except there really was a mechanic for it already, in your relationship to individual characters. Legitimacy is, by a modern definition, the personal belief in the authority of a figure or an institution. Now instead of your character having a personal relationship with every other character, and that reflecting their individual loyalties to you as a ruler, their opinion is collated into a monolithic bar that you must seek to fill with video game points. 

Again, it is a reflection of a reality, rather than a mirror, but there was already a much better reflection in the game. One that was far more subtle. 

In truth this betrays an even greater problem with the game. What is the difference between authority and power? Power is the ability to make someone do something through threat of violence. Authority is the ability to command someone righteously. The Catholic Church, as portrayed in the game, is barely an entity. In reality, in the Middle Ages, it was the authoritative institution of the West. 

To have any legitimacy in a ruler, in a representation of the Christian West, the Church must be the authority to dispense that legitimacy. 

Feasts and hunts and fine robes do not a King make. Not in this place and this time period (or ever really). The authority of such things has to be lodged in something more than the material world. It has to come from a metaphysical ideal. In that regard, CK3 is like a scientific treatise. It proffers a neutral, sterilized view of the world in which the only recognized legitimacy at all is the ability and willingness to use violence to get what you want.

It happened to me and I am still mad about it.
Plagues are interesting, and definitely add a much needed threat for the player - but it still feels like it could have been better, and IMO outbreaks seem to be biased to happen in the player's territory, or at least in close proximity.
On top of that, full of bugs, and it's a shame that this is the expected standard by now from Paradox.

Also, minor detail, but, on release day, in the Developer Livestream there was a question from the community if Isolationist cultures get a bonus to plague resistance, which was affirmed by a Dev, but in the game, if this is true, there is no indicator for it in the cultural tradition. I doubt they actually implemented it. Could be a honest mistake, or could be an indicator for greater issues at Paradox.

I have tried to be as optimistic and fair as possible but I just cannot understand the praise this DLC gets from the community. Compare it to Bloodlines in CK2 and it's just a pure joke.

This DLC is not substandard, it is not terribly unbalanced or anything like that. It is simply... meh. Legends fade way too quickly, you would think the exalted among men emperor of the newly restored Roman Empire, who claims to be the son of a lynx and visited by god would be something remembered forever in the annuals of history? Nope, in about two generations literally everybody has forgotten about him- Not even a mention of his name. The legends are generic too which really doesn't help the situation. The best example of this is Ottar ""Die Vogel"" of house Babenberger, a legendary ruler who restored the Holy Roman Empire from a mere county in Wien, destroying his enemies and launching grand holy wars into England, overrun by heathens. 

This sounds awesome right? Something mentioned in his legend ""Battle of Cumberland"" the battle which decided the fate of Scotland, England and Ireland? Nope, the legend mentions how he visited Canterbury and some generic event where he is 'visited by god' which is actually just a 100 year old randomly generated lowborn character, it doesn't even get the details of the battle itself correct, Ottar had no reinforcements or aid from anybody, his snake-like Karling allies refusing to aid him in his noble quest for Christendom... yet it says here how the battle was nearly lost (which is correct until a battle roll went in his favour) until his horsemen (the only men at arms unit I hadn't invested in) smashed through the enemy Varangian heavy infantry... a unit that counters heavy horsemen.

The legends in short are painfully generic, nothing unique about them exists. All the origin legends detail about how you were born from a pool of Ragnarr Lothbrok or Arthur Pendragon's own 'flesh and blood'. Cool, until you see it again, and again, and again and then some more halfway across the world. These origin legends are pretty much exclusive to Europe too, nothing in Persia claiming to be from the ages of Darius, nothing in Greece about Alexander the GREAT, nothing about Genghis Khan after he falls, imagine how cool that would be? Nope.

To conclude, all the legends feel like they were written by chat GPT, nothing unique or interesting about them, to add insult to injury, Ottar's statue didn't even have his name on it, just generic flavour text about a ruler immortalized in stone. His legend faded and in 2 generations, the legendary ruler of the HRE, destroyer of heathens, incredible commander and wily as a hawk had faded into complete obscurity, the only reminder of his existence being a small statue in Cumberland with a popular opinion boost.

Legitimacy feels very poorly balanced and overall just punitive and removing of more player agency over their realm. Perhaps there can be a proper balancing of it but it really feels far more stick than carrot. The legitimacy hits from disinheriting for example are needlessly expensive, especially when it's having secondary children take the vows...

Disease meanwhile feels marginally less fleshed out than in CK2 reapers due, ESPECIALLY in terms of Hospitals and Plague vulnerability/resistance, the barony buildings really feel less enjoyable to engage with than Hospitals in CK2.

legends are the most half baked feature to come out of ck3 yet. even court artefact spamming has some level of interaction with it, but legends are truly awful. its start legend, wait for a bit, mindlessly click through event spam about it (I have seen the same event 4 separate times in the same playthrough for multiple events), click button to upgrade, repeat this step again, then click complete, get some generic bonuses or some region specific claims, and now you can never use this legend again for the rest of the game. 

that's right, in a game about dynastic succession, about seeing how each character's actions build onto each other, only one character in your entire dynasty can use a legend seed. according to this dlc, if Louis the stammerer claimed to be the decedent of Charlemagne, none of his line afterwards could EVER claim the same again. the biggest middle finger to the player? after all is said and done, and you complete your so called 'legend', not only does it die off the map completely in just a few decades, but you cant even read the chronicle. that's right, the devs who claim this is a role-playing game as an excuse for giving us barely any mechanics besides event spam for 3 years, have the main role-play feature of their new dlc straight up disappear from player view almost instantly.
 
the common sense way to do this is have legends actually affect your dynasty long term, and give them a set of standards to adhere too to appear more like their claimed ancestor. If you want people to see you as the heir of Charlemagne, defeat the Saracens in battle, have a group of famed knights who you ride into battle with, be crowned by the pope, defeat rebellious vassals, etc. if you fail at these things, people will see you as not living up to your claimed ancestry, giving worse penalties then failing these things normally. the worst part is that most of these issues cant be fixed by modding. I have looked into (and posted) a mod that tries to fix legends, but with how fundamentally flawed the system at its core, a mod can only put a bandied on the bullet wound.

plagues are pretty solid, if deadly (as they should be to an extent), but could have used a bit more depth which they could have gotten if resources were not wasted on the abysmal legends system. pretty self explanatory tbh, if you have played ck2, they are not too different

as for bugs, I have noticed some with the new sound effects (which im not a fan of compared to the old), and some bigger ones, like a random unlanded character occupying land for some inexplicable reason.

overall legends are awful, being yet another event spam coated with an unintuitive ui over it, and the additions the dlc gives to plagues are not worth it, as most of the new plague mechanics are base game. skip if you didn't buy chapter 3, and if you were like me and got blinded by byzantine empire and landless hype and instantly clicked buy on chapter 3, lets pray that they make up for this. ck3 cant (or rather shouldn't) survive another year of disappointments like the last few."

Personally i deem procedurally generated content to be a great way of increasing the variation and the longevity of content within a game.

However; if not enough care is taken to properly, and logically, integrate such content within a game this content can be very distracting, bad, and non-immersive.

The inclusion of legends could be grand for the game. To experience how your deeds not only influence the world, but also the tales told about your dynasty within it would be amazingly immersive. To see how bards, and sometimes you, twist truth into a more exciting form could be fun.

But sadly, legends fall under the category of badly procedurally generated content.

Take the following example:

My ruler was King Dumnarth of Cornwall. One of my favorite starts in 867, btw. It¬¥s fun to enter the fight for britain as a brythonic ruler.

King Dumnarth conquered the neighboring duchies of Wessex and Hwicce rather easily. And then, in a bid to increase his legitimacy and gather some prestige, he started spreading the legend that he and his line are descended from King Arthur.

While doing so Britanny was conquered by a norse Adventurer. King Dumnarth set sail in order to conquer free his bretic brethren from the Heathens. He won some great victories and drove them off, adding Britanny to his Demesne.

Then he proclaimed the Kingdom of Dumnonia. (Via the found a new kingdom decision, not the restore the kingdom of cornwall one.)

In gameplay terms this wasn¬¥t that much. In in-universe terms, though, this was something rather significant. A major victory against the Norse invaders was won and a new bretic kingdom, spanning the channel, formed.

This is the stuff of legends! What better to support his claim of descent from King Arthur, than to prove such undertakings!

However, it isn¬¥t reflected in the legend. At all.

The Legend fails in two ways, both the result of badly procedurally generated content. Content which is completely random, without being integrated in a sensible manner.

1.) It doesn¬¥t tie into the King Arthur myth at all. Arthur is mentioned once, but aside from this- nothing. It doesn¬¥t tie into this claim logically. A basic way this could, and has been done, would be to claim descent from him. Or to claim to have performed similiar feats. (Being visited by Merlin, finding excalibur, something.)

Instead the non-sensical claim of being birthed from a pool of blood and flesh is given. Yeah. Even though many people still alive in his kingdom will have known his parents. The same claim can be found in many other generated legends.

2.) It doesn¬¥t properly take into account which deeds of his have been noteworthy. I don¬¥t know how the selection works- If simply some deeds are eligible and some not, or if purely some random ones are chosen- But in this legend it didn¬¥t deign to mention his conquest of brittany and the victory over heathen invaders, nor does it mention the founding of a new kingdom.

Instead it chose to mention that one time he rode to some church, two baronies away from the border of his kingdom.

Plagues and new disease mechanics: Mostly part of the free patch and  as far as I can tell basically lifted 1:1 from CK2 and the parts that are part of the DLC are sold back to players at an insane price, despite the assertions from Paradox that they were going to take time to put thought into new systems and mechanics to expand the game past what existed in CK2 - at least characters actually die now though this entire change now continues the trend of adding more and more costs to the game with no way to supplement income the game is still functioning on the basic economy system from CK2 a game that is almost 15 years old

Legitimacy: A shoehorned system that just adds further hoops to jump through to keep vassals in line seems mostly designed to encourage people to use the horrible and repetitive hold court feature from Royal Court the other horrible content release for CK3 - just another random stat you have to manage to keep people from rebelling ever few years and even when you do manage it the system only serves to force you to play in one way

[u]Bloodlines in CK2[/u]
Bloodlines were not only more dynamic but also more fun to collect. One of my favourite things to do in Ck2 was to consolidate bloodlines through intricate breeding projects. It needed planning, patience, determination and knowledge of different game mechanics. If you did not start with a bloodline you also had the option to set an ambition to create one. These created bloodlines could vary [b]wildly[/b], from peaceful ruler to bloodthirsty murderer and gave permanent modifiers that corresponded with the type of bloodline. There were in total [b]THIRTY+[/b] unique bloodlines the player could create. These were great for RP and gameplay. You could look back at your ancestor and go, ""Damn that guy that got the warrior lodge bloodline was a badass"" while also getting the prowess from being related to him. 

[u]Legends in CK3[/u]
Legends of the dead gives you [b]FOUR[/b] types of legends. Heroic, saint, legitimacy and an unofficial ancestor one. 
Heroic gives you claims, saint converts your realm and legitimacy gives you legitimacy and ancestor let's you revive a dead culture. That's the long and the short of it. You get extra things like a special building slot and an artefact which are ok. The legend is not permanent and costs 1/4 of your income over five years to produce. During these five years you have little to no impact of what the ""legend"" will actually say. 

Most of the time the legend will be filled with what feels like ChatGPT gibberish of plagues, bandits and local lords. As such the legend description with the exception of some will feel the same. Conquering Byzantium, mending the Schism, dismantling the Papacy and restoring Rome legends were nearly indistinguishable from each other in my run. People also seem to have the memory of goldfish, legends like King Arthur which have been passed down from 12th century to today are seemingly forgotten within decades. Legends like King Arthur are also known worldwide and feature in the pop culture of nations thousands of kilometres from Wales. In CK3 you'll be lucky if the peasants in Rome even know who restored the empire because the legend can only expand to 501 baronies.

[u]Plagues[/u]
The three extra ones and the black death are also part of this DLC I guess. They're fine but with all the difficulty settings set to max they're at most a nuisance.

Legends are character-specific (No Legends that define your dynasty like CK2 Bloodlines) and while they can be inherited, they are not inherited by your heir, rather your legend goes to a arbitrarily-assigned dynasty member and frankly, I have no clue how the game decides who gets it. That's assuming you die soon enough for it to be inherited, since most legends deactivate after a few decades. Apparently single-handily stopping a viking invasion stops mattering after 20 years, and nobody cares if your father unified England and claimed descent from King Arthur.

Legitimacy is a complete joke. It's character-specific, not title specific, so the game does not care about the scenario the devs themselves pointed out (Whether or not a French warrior-prince should be considered the rightful ruler of Byzantium), as long as you were legitimate in whatever title you had before, you're legitimate in all of them. 

Also a sudden UI revamp that, while not that bad honestly, came out of nowhere and they replaced all the click sounds with a very annoying ""Sword unsheathe, sword sheath"" sound that grates on you very quickly. Again, nothing like this was mentioned in the dev diaries and there is currently no way to change it.

There is also none of the flavor additions that CK2's Reaper's Due DLC gave, such as multiple execution methods.

Paradox keeps on missing. They had a solid base in CK2 and instead of refining it or adapting it for CK3, they decided to get ''creative''. What they came up with falls short of anything they promised in the trailers and dev blogs.

- Legends disappear after 20-something years after being made. They don't require any specific actions unlike they did in CK2, essentially you pay once, and then wait for the map to be painted with ''your legend is spreading''
- More than half of the events that are supposed to increase legitimacy don't work, I've tried different events: tours, feasts, weddings, funerals, so on. Only feasts had an actual even that actually increased legitimacy.
- Legitimacy system in itself is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, you can have the same family ruling the kingdom/empire since the start of the game and some rulers will randomly start with legitimacy at max and others have it at maybe 1st or 2nd out of 5 levels.
- Plagues are nothing more than a nuisance and money sink for rebuilding efforts, and that's it. You'll see constant pop-ups ''Isolate yourself/capital'' each time any plague shows up on the  map. (A simple fix to that would be to make this option become an event ONLY when the plague reaches your personal domain - Paradox, take notes)"

Yet another DLC that adds new features that have a lot of promise, but needed significantly more development time to make them good. It seems like their business model these days is to create a barebones framework that the modders can finish for them.

I've played significantly more now and wow this DLC's new mechanics are a hot mess. I'll review it with the new free update.

1) Legitimacy. It's interesting, but not a single character starts with any levels of legitimacy, so the early game for everyone is just going to be a slog with needing to gain legitimacy

2) Diseases. oh diseases. This has been been something we have asked PDS to give us for several years now. It was a machochist's love from CK2, and now it's here, except now it's really annoying. diseases come every couple of years in random spots in the world, meaning if you're nearby any or you have a large empire, you're going to get event spammed with the same 3 events over and over and over again. the result from the events are never beneficial. they just happen. 

3) Legends. the big selling point and the thing actually on sale with this DLC is just ok. they're neat, but they are not spell/grammar checked at all, and are abusable. The AI will pursue legends, because why wouldn't you, and will often try to pay you to help spread the legend. but you spreading the legend costs gold per month to upkeep, so it really isn't worth your time much. so you can take their gold, and immediately stop promoting the legend. now if balance was a thing that existed, you might take a prestige hit, after all you just broke a deal? nope. maybe you lose some legitimacy, that cool new feature with this update? still no. ok, how about just an opinion hit? nope. It's free money, it's just free money. and that same character will try to pay you again a few months later, so we do the same thing again.
Legends spread from county to county based on who is spreading the legend and from a radius around where it originated, but there is a max to how far a legend can spread. The way it spreads is almost like a disease would spread, and that is probably why we got diseases in this update as well. Overall Legends are super underdeveloped and don't really add much to your gameplay

4) Funerals. Ah funerals the new activity you can do to gain legitimacy, lower stress, gain prestige, boost opinions, ... seduce someone, murder someone else. It's honestly a great activity. There's even an event during it where characters will reminisce on memories they have from the memories journal. except that characters don't generate memories of other characters at all, so the only thing they reminisce about them is when they declared war on them, slept with them, they died, or they killed them. most of the time they aren't even known as the killer. they just out themselves with a ""i killed him yeah""

This DLC is a super underdeveloped product and I genuinely cannot recommend this for $20. maybe try again when its on sale with a steep discount. and wait until it gets more patches to fix the glaring issues, which will probably never come."

But instead with this dlc, a legend only stays around for 100 years when you get it to mythical tier on the COUNTIES, not your dynasty. CK 2 did this much much better. No legend is permenant in this DLC. Legends should be completely permenant like how we know about King Arthur Pendragon to this day and how some dynasties in history claimed to be coming from them.

The Legends: A cool concept that give good rewards but are effectively a money sink. Range from a simple boost to development and skill boosts to ""you now have a claim to every independent title in Iberia"". The events around legends can be enjoyable but once you promote one legend to mythical status, you have seen all the events (and even your first time there can be repetition). My biggest complaint is that legends only last 20 years once completed, even though, especially if your pushing mythical, it can be a multi-generational effort, and unless you go all the way some of the rewards are RNG.

The dead: Imma be 100% funerals should have been part of the free update. The plagues are ok, adding to the chaos of the game and a more dynamic if intangible threat, and diseases are now actually scary at times. Havnt actually played long enough to see the black death so cant comment on it but from what I have seen from the community it seems pretty interesting, though you lose a absolute ton of development. Overall 7/10, you get whats on the tin.

Legitimacy: ok this is free update content but I need to rant somewhere, legitimacy is annoying. You lose way to much to plagues and losing a single battle but winning wars SOMETIMES give as much as back as losing a battle, but WINNING a battle outnumbered 3:1 does...nothing. Unless you do a legitimizing legend you can spend 50 years building up to level four, only for about 3-4 bad events in about the same amount of years knocks you to tier 3. And as for what tier is considered ""acceptable"" for your rank? Dont know, it bounced between 3-4 when I was a king, and always seemed to be where I was at least one level behind. Most of the advantages of high legitimacy are moot since unlike royal court each tier doesnt give benefits, only negates a penalty, while being over legitimacy is nigh impossible for kings who can actually make use of the bonuses like ""increased vassal acceptance chance"" but good luck maxing out the bar and keeping it for more then a year."

Legitimacy is a new mechanic tied to the legends feature, but you don't need the DLC to have this mechanic. If you are an usurper or startup ruler, you will have a slight struggle especially if your vassals are of different culture than you and your cultural acceptance is low. This mechanic adds a slight complexity on how vassals will accept your rule but overall not that impactful.

Plagues are another new mechanic added to the game which is basically also not that impactful since plague strength isn't that optimized even at full strength. You'll see ""casualties"" pertaining to the plague in question but it'll usually fizzle out before even killing 100 people, which is kinda underwhelming. I had to tell my court physician not to help with the plague so that I could actually experience the mechanic on my city. There are also no random events tied to plagues like not washing your hands after a hunt or falling into a latrine, causing a plague on your household if you have low learning, etc. Overall, plagues appear to be quite bland and just spams you with notifications of plagues that are just minor annoyances.

Let's get into fine details, shall we?

[h2]Plagues[/h2]

So, for the uninitiated, CK3 is a character-driven and focused RPG-meets-Sims game. Back when the game released 3 years ago, the design intent was to really invest into your characters, make them live long, have great education and congenital traits. The game really encouraged that with mechanics like Long/Short Reign, legacies like Octogenarians and Graceful Aging etc. However, a part of the community complained the game is not ""hardcore"" enough. As a result we got so called ""harm events"" in one of the updates, with the idea of randomly forcing death/crippling events on your characters and going completely against everything established previously. 

Plagues is the continuation of the trend. It adds the separate ""elderly heath"" stat to further cripple your characters beyond certain age, and otherwise all it does is randomly forces diseases on them. If previously my Rurik would live into his 60th - with this DLC he died in the early 50th from smallpox, and his son Helgi inherited at 27 and instantly got cancer. RIP. In the game where unplanned character death is akin to having your saves wiped it goes without saying how terrible these additions are. And the plagues are so constant that I eventually learned to live with them and ignore the constant buttons for ""Go into seclusion"" and ""Isolate the capital"" popping on my screen.

[h2]Legitimacy[/h2]

This mechanics is simple ""win more"" power creep that if you're a good player makes the game even easier and if you struggle makes it even worse for you. Win a few wars and do a feast and you notice it's easier to vassalize or make alliances. Lose a battle though, and you are hit with internal instability on top of that. Marry a beautiful lowborn girl and you're now hit with legitimacy penalty on top of the prestige one. The rising legitimacy expectations based on your rank are there to make it more difficult to keep kingdoms and empires together. However, this mechanics is superficial and in reality does little to change how the game is played. Like if you have the biggest army and the wealthiest domain around - you can pretty much forget legitimacy exists. 

[h2]Legends[/h2]

And this is a money sink. In the early game, maintaining and spreading a legend will cost you the money you could have spent on a large army, making it not really viable. And in the late game the rewards of the mechanics are pretty irrelevant. Imagine spending 3 legacy points to get a perk that grants your character a Saint trait, but you need to work for 100-200 years to complete a Mythic holy legend for it. The most important reward for legend completion are ""Legendary buildings"" - however those compete with existing Special buildings and Holy Sites for slots and end up being less powerful versions of those. This makes legends pointless if your domain is something like Paris or Rome, and while it could be useful if you want to make your domain in the middle of nowhere somewhat viable - you wouldn't have the funds to get it done in the first place. And the last reward is a book containing the legend (with random text which feels like written by ChatGPT) which only the character who completed the legend can commission for an additional sum of gold.

So there you have it - one mechanics that is harmful to the experience, one mechanics that is plain unnecessary, and one more that could be good if it wasn't half-baked and designed to be more than a money sink."

The pros are:

1) Plagues and Diseases are back. And they are a bit of fun.
2) It has some fun additions for Roleplaying purposes despite being more of a systemic pack.
3) The UI has gotten a lot better too. Espescially for some of the older mechanics as court positions.
4) While you could cheese Legitimacy and Legends it is more fun to let them run in a more role playing like style.

The cons are:

1) Legends could need more depth and there should be some more unique legends for many regions (Persia could need at least three more. Tibet also and why are things like the G√∂kturks not really a seed. I don't want to start with Africa).
2) Also there should be some ancestrial legends of your Dynasty in the late game.
3) The AI seems to have issues with legitimacy? I have the feel that they sometimes let it fall apart even with being able to avoid this situation.

For me it is a 7/10. It is not as good as Fate of Iberia or Tours and Tournaments and is a fine addition. Either get it in the Chaptr 3 Bundle or in a Sale as it is not amazing T&T or an all around good pack as Fate of Iberia.

I recommend buying it on sale or getting the bundle because Roads to Power seems like it will actually be great.

Granted, a fair share of the core returning plague mechanics are part of the free ""scythe"" update, only some extra elements and more expanded bits are part of the DLC pack related to the plague mechanics such as funerals, additional varieties in plagues, more fleshed out Black Death. 

However the 2nd focus those being legends which sounded like about the same what we had with bloodlines in CK2's final update fall kinda flat due one major issue, there is no way extend a legend , legends you create for your character and dynasti fade away in mere years which makes no sense, this is an issue that honestly can very easily be fixed by simply increasing somewhat how long a legend can exist and adding some simple additional mechanic in which future generation can keep the family legends going and have them always be inherited. 

Due to to the issue of the bizarrely short legends, a lot of people who unlike me maybe weren't mainly excited for the plagues but instead for the legends mechanic were let down thus , this has dropped to mixed reviews but since i am someone who primarily was excited and focused on the plagues returning, the legends stuff was more of an extra side thing for me so it didn't bum me out when it turned out it has this weird design flaw that i do hope will be fixed.

So due to this, i am still really happy, i was so excited to see dynamic plagues and diseases come back , though i would suggest waiting for a bit of a discount on this DLC, it's more worth it for like 15 bucks, maybe a tad less, i did get mine from a 3rd party store where they had a slight discount dropping it to 15 which felt more fair then these bizzare new awful prices they hiked up for CK3 DLC a year or so ago.

I think the plague mechanics are fine, though the base system was added to the main game for free, so really you're just paying for a few extra potential negative modifiers, names of plagues, and one RNG event chain. Legitimacy is pretty interesting as well and makes the game more challenging by giving you more penalties for trying to marry Genius peasants into your bloodline. But, once again legitimacy was added to the base game for free so it's not something you're paying for. They're starting to add ""Sub-tasks"" that your court positions like the Physician can do, which is great and gives the player more control over their court, but once again that's free with the base game.

So, if most of the major features of the DLC are actually free with the base game, what do you get here? A couple of RNG event chains, a handful of new clothes, the ability to hold funerals, and Legends. Legends feels like something thrown together at the last second to justify this being a major update and ""Major"" DLC instead of a major update and minor DLC. Through the mechanic of ""Legends"" players are now supposed to be able to create lasting legends for their dynasty that make you out to be a hero, legitimize your dynasty's right to rule, or turn you into a saint among men. That all sounds great on paper, but in reality Legends are little more than an RNG gold sink. You have no real power over what your legend is about, what deeds it promotes, or what the final story will be, in fact the final legend feels like chatGPT was fed every memory of my character and then forced to spit out the most mundane drivel it could think of. 
""Here's the legend of how kind Midas walked two counties over to visit a church."" Meanwhile in my lifetime I united an entire kingdom and drove out a massive plague. The rewards for creating a Legend include an ok artifact, and a ""Legendary"" building. These legendary buildings compete for existing duchy buildings and are generally simply on par with what you can already build though they do have some nice models for the buildings. 
To top it off legends are not a permanent thing despite all the effort that goes into building them. Depending on how much money and effort you sunk into a legend it will stick around for between 20 and 100 years. That's right, you can create a ""Legend"" and still be alive when everyone has forgotten all about it. King Arthur who? Saint Edward, never heard of him. Now, I could see legends needing upkeep if the rewards were truly powerful, and the need to erase or supersede a legend to create a new one, but the fact that they're called LEGENDS and are forgotten in less than a generation is terrible design and it makes it feel pretty bad creating them.
CK2 already did legends better, they were called bloodlines. The devs need to take a look back at what they already did and improve upon it instead of creating worse, less interesting features.

Seeing my king create a legend at just 30 years old, only to see it totally disappear WHILE HE IS STILL ALIVE AND MAKING NEW CONQUESTS, sounds very stupid, doesn't it?

I hope that the community's comments will be listened to and that this problem will be solved, if not by Paradox then at least by the community itself (thanks to all the modders out there btw, you truly are the best that mankind can offer) which would save us again from a mechanic created and promptly abandoned.

So the plague system is basically Reapers DLC from CK2; diseases and plagues are more deadly and have more consequences, which is excellent.

Unfortunately, the Legends system is poorly implemented; legends are costly to maintain yet do not last very long; aside from the most important legitimacy gain, there really isn't any reason to interact with the Legends system. 
As mentioned, Legends lasts a very short while after it's completed, and without dynastic interaction or any interaction with conquered land, the legends mechanic feels really hollow and shallow a system.

Legitimacy itself is also not anything interesting. Firstly, legitimacy gives buffs and debuffs, but does not affect the way claims are pushed if anything it feels more like short reign and long reign debuff and buff, respectively and feels redundant with the way it is implemented. 

Secondly the easiest way to gain legitimacy is through warfare, as other activities such as feasts, tours and weddinngs etc. are very costly. This now discourages play styles do not involve warfare, for example diplomacy and intrigue play styles will generate little to no legitimacy which almost guarantees that you will have to play the game with a major debuff.

 
Overall the legends and Legitimacy mechanic has a lot of potential and perhaps in the future there would be a touch up on this DLC to smooth out the implementation of the mechanics.

On top of that it's weird that you build up the legend yourself, as if a legend is some sort of ""top down"" thing in our world, rather than a story that gets passed around a community until it becomes something more than whatever event touched it off. I understand this is a video game, and that it is a representation of the world rather than a mirror of it, but this is so awkward and false in its execution, in its logic, that I cannot look past it. 

Legitimacy, a new mechanic meant to reflect how your community/realm views you, seems like a great idea at the start. Except there really was a mechanic for it already, in your relationship to individual characters. Legitimacy is, by a modern definition, the personal belief in the authority of a figure or an institution. Now instead of your character having a personal relationship with every other character, and that reflecting their individual loyalties to you as a ruler, their opinion is collated into a monolithic bar that you must seek to fill with video game points. 

Again, it is a reflection of a reality, rather than a mirror, but there was already a much better reflection in the game. One that was far more subtle. 

In truth this betrays an even greater problem with the game. What is the difference between authority and power? Power is the ability to make someone do something through threat of violence. Authority is the ability to command someone righteously. The Catholic Church, as portrayed in the game, is barely an entity. In reality, in the Middle Ages, it was the authoritative institution of the West. 

To have any legitimacy in a ruler, in a representation of the Christian West, the Church must be the authority to dispense that legitimacy. 

Feasts and hunts and fine robes do not a King make. Not in this place and this time period (or ever really). The authority of such things has to be lodged in something more than the material world. It has to come from a metaphysical ideal. In that regard, CK3 is like a scientific treatise. It proffers a neutral, sterilized view of the world in which the only recognized legitimacy at all is the ability and willingness to use violence to get what you want.

You are meant to get legitimacy by going to war and doing events but while between 0-100 you only sometimes get legitimacy going to war and about 10 for an event so good luck spamming feasts and hunts for 30 years and hope you can get out of the death spiral.
Finally the worst thing to come from this is certain starting character start with high legitimacy and so they have more power and they have the power to vassalize people even if those people are not de jure apart of their duchy or kingdom.

Also some of the rewards for completing a legend (e.g. legendary artifact commission) require your legend to be present, first of all legends disappear COMPLETELY without trace after two decades at most, and when you use your legendary adventure casus belli before creating the artifact, and go somewhere remote, you will never be able to complete that artifact. It happened to me and I am still mad about it.
Plagues are interesting, and definitely add a much needed threat for the player - but it still feels like it could have been better, and IMO outbreaks seem to be biased to happen in the player's territory, or at least in close proximity.
On top of that, full of bugs, and it's a shame that this is the expected standard by now from Paradox.

Also, minor detail, but, on release day, in the Developer Livestream there was a question from the community if Isolationist cultures get a bonus to plague resistance, which was affirmed by a Dev, but in the game, if this is true, there is no indicator for it in the cultural tradition. I doubt they actually implemented it. Could be a honest mistake, or could be an indicator for greater issues at Paradox.

I have tried to be as optimistic and fair as possible but I just cannot understand the praise this DLC gets from the community. Compare it to Bloodlines in CK2 and it's just a pure joke.

This DLC is not substandard, it is not terribly unbalanced or anything like that. It is simply... meh. Legends fade way too quickly, you would think the exalted among men emperor of the newly restored Roman Empire, who claims to be the son of a lynx and visited by god would be something remembered forever in the annuals of history? Nope, in about two generations literally everybody has forgotten about him- Not even a mention of his name. The legends are generic too which really doesn't help the situation. The best example of this is Ottar ""Die Vogel"" of house Babenberger, a legendary ruler who restored the Holy Roman Empire from a mere county in Wien, destroying his enemies and launching grand holy wars into England, overrun by heathens. 

This sounds awesome right? Something mentioned in his legend ""Battle of Cumberland"" the battle which decided the fate of Scotland, England and Ireland? Nope, the legend mentions how he visited Canterbury and some generic event where he is 'visited by god' which is actually just a 100 year old randomly generated lowborn character, it doesn't even get the details of the battle itself correct, Ottar had no reinforcements or aid from anybody, his snake-like Karling allies refusing to aid him in his noble quest for Christendom... yet it says here how the battle was nearly lost (which is correct until a battle roll went in his favour) until his horsemen (the only men at arms unit I hadn't invested in) smashed through the enemy Varangian heavy infantry... a unit that counters heavy horsemen.

The legends in short are painfully generic, nothing unique about them exists. All the origin legends detail about how you were born from a pool of Ragnarr Lothbrok or Arthur Pendragon's own 'flesh and blood'. Cool, until you see it again, and again, and again and then some more halfway across the world. These origin legends are pretty much exclusive to Europe too, nothing in Persia claiming to be from the ages of Darius, nothing in Greece about Alexander the GREAT, nothing about Genghis Khan after he falls, imagine how cool that would be? Nope.

To conclude, all the legends feel like they were written by chat GPT, nothing unique or interesting about them, to add insult to injury, Ottar's statue didn't even have his name on it, just generic flavour text about a ruler immortalized in stone. His legend faded and in 2 generations, the legendary ruler of the HRE, destroyer of heathens, incredible commander and wily as a hawk had faded into complete obscurity, the only reminder of his existence being a small statue in Cumberland with a popular opinion boost.

This DLC is a for sure buy when it is on SALE, otherwise, it has nothing of value to add to this game. I hope the next one is a bit better.

It really feels like a much, much worse version of bloodlines to me.

Legitimacy feels very poorly balanced and overall just punitive and removing of more player agency over their realm. Perhaps there can be a proper balancing of it but it really feels far more stick than carrot. The legitimacy hits from disinheriting for example are needlessly expensive, especially when it's having secondary children take the vows...

Disease meanwhile feels marginally less fleshed out than in CK2 reapers due, ESPECIALLY in terms of Hospitals and Plague vulnerability/resistance, the barony buildings really feel less enjoyable to engage with than Hospitals in CK2.

76561198089885315,2671060,False,0.542478442192077637,"edited cause after playing more its clear how shit of a mechanic legends are:

legends are the most half baked feature to come out of ck3 yet. even court artefact spamming has some level of interaction with it, but legends are truly awful. its start legend, wait for a bit, mindlessly click through event spam about it (I have seen the same event 4 separate times in the same playthrough for multiple events), click button to upgrade, repeat this step again, then click complete, get some generic bonuses or some region specific claims, and now you can never use this legend again for the rest of the game. 

that's right, in a game about dynastic succession, about seeing how each character's actions build onto each other, only one character in your entire dynasty can use a legend seed. according to this dlc, if Louis the stammerer claimed to be the decedent of Charlemagne, none of his line afterwards could EVER claim the same again. the biggest middle finger to the player? after all is said and done, and you complete your so called 'legend', not only does it die off the map completely in just a few decades, but you cant even read the chronicle. that's right, the devs who claim this is a role-playing game as an excuse for giving us barely any mechanics besides event spam for 3 years, have the main role-play feature of their new dlc straight up disappear from player view almost instantly.
 
the common sense way to do this is have legends actually affect your dynasty long term, and give them a set of standards to adhere too to appear more like their claimed ancestor. If you want people to see you as the heir of Charlemagne, defeat the Saracens in battle, have a group of famed knights who you ride into battle with, be crowned by the pope, defeat rebellious vassals, etc. if you fail at these things, people will see you as not living up to your claimed ancestry, giving worse penalties then failing these things normally. the worst part is that most of these issues cant be fixed by modding. I have looked into (and posted) a mod that tries to fix legends, but with how fundamentally flawed the system at its core, a mod can only put a bandied on the bullet wound.

plagues are pretty solid, if deadly (as they should be to an extent), but could have used a bit more depth which they could have gotten if resources were not wasted on the abysmal legends system. pretty self explanatory tbh, if you have played ck2, they are not too different

as for bugs, I have noticed some with the new sound effects (which im not a fan of compared to the old), and some bigger ones, like a random unlanded character occupying land for some inexplicable reason.

overall legends are awful, being yet another event spam coated with an unintuitive ui over it, and the additions the dlc gives to plagues are not worth it, as most of the new plague mechanics are base game. skip if you didn't buy chapter 3, and if you were like me and got blinded by byzantine empire and landless hype and instantly clicked buy on chapter 3, lets pray that they make up for this. ck3 cant (or rather shouldn't) survive another year of disappointments like the last few."

Personally i deem procedurally generated content to be a great way of increasing the variation and the longevity of content within a game.

However; if not enough care is taken to properly, and logically, integrate such content within a game this content can be very distracting, bad, and non-immersive.

The inclusion of legends could be grand for the game. To experience how your deeds not only influence the world, but also the tales told about your dynasty within it would be amazingly immersive. To see how bards, and sometimes you, twist truth into a more exciting form could be fun.

But sadly, legends fall under the category of badly procedurally generated content.

Take the following example:

My ruler was King Dumnarth of Cornwall. One of my favorite starts in 867, btw. It¬¥s fun to enter the fight for britain as a brythonic ruler.

King Dumnarth conquered the neighboring duchies of Wessex and Hwicce rather easily. And then, in a bid to increase his legitimacy and gather some prestige, he started spreading the legend that he and his line are descended from King Arthur.

While doing so Britanny was conquered by a norse Adventurer. King Dumnarth set sail in order to conquer free his bretic brethren from the Heathens. He won some great victories and drove them off, adding Britanny to his Demesne.

Then he proclaimed the Kingdom of Dumnonia. (Via the found a new kingdom decision, not the restore the kingdom of cornwall one.)

In gameplay terms this wasn¬¥t that much. In in-universe terms, though, this was something rather significant. A major victory against the Norse invaders was won and a new bretic kingdom, spanning the channel, formed.

This is the stuff of legends! What better to support his claim of descent from King Arthur, than to prove such undertakings!

However, it isn¬¥t reflected in the legend. At all.

The Legend fails in two ways, both the result of badly procedurally generated content. Content which is completely random, without being integrated in a sensible manner.

1.) It doesn¬¥t tie into the King Arthur myth at all. Arthur is mentioned once, but aside from this- nothing. It doesn¬¥t tie into this claim logically. A basic way this could, and has been done, would be to claim descent from him. Or to claim to have performed similiar feats. (Being visited by Merlin, finding excalibur, something.)

Instead the non-sensical claim of being birthed from a pool of blood and flesh is given. Yeah. Even though many people still alive in his kingdom will have known his parents. The same claim can be found in many other generated legends.

2.) It doesn¬¥t properly take into account which deeds of his have been noteworthy. I don¬¥t know how the selection works- If simply some deeds are eligible and some not, or if purely some random ones are chosen- But in this legend it didn¬¥t deign to mention his conquest of brittany and the victory over heathen invaders, nor does it mention the founding of a new kingdom.

Instead it chose to mention that one time he rode to some church, two baronies away from the border of his kingdom.

This isn¬¥t a fictionalised story of my character. This is [PICK RANDOM TEXT 1] + [PICK RANDOM TEXT 2] + [PICK RANDOM MEMORY FROM ROOT_CHARACTER].

Plagues and new disease mechanics: Mostly part of the free patch and  as far as I can tell basically lifted 1:1 from CK2 and the parts that are part of the DLC are sold back to players at an insane price, despite the assertions from Paradox that they were going to take time to put thought into new systems and mechanics to expand the game past what existed in CK2 - at least characters actually die now though this entire change now continues the trend of adding more and more costs to the game with no way to supplement income the game is still functioning on the basic economy system from CK2 a game that is almost 15 years old

Legitimacy: A shoehorned system that just adds further hoops to jump through to keep vassals in line seems mostly designed to encourage people to use the horrible and repetitive hold court feature from Royal Court the other horrible content release for CK3 - just another random stat you have to manage to keep people from rebelling ever few years and even when you do manage it the system only serves to force you to play in one way

[u]Bloodlines in CK2[/u]
Bloodlines were not only more dynamic but also more fun to collect. One of my favourite things to do in Ck2 was to consolidate bloodlines through intricate breeding projects. It needed planning, patience, determination and knowledge of different game mechanics. If you did not start with a bloodline you also had the option to set an ambition to create one. These created bloodlines could vary [b]wildly[/b], from peaceful ruler to bloodthirsty murderer and gave permanent modifiers that corresponded with the type of bloodline. There were in total [b]THIRTY+[/b] unique bloodlines the player could create. These were great for RP and gameplay. You could look back at your ancestor and go, ""Damn that guy that got the warrior lodge bloodline was a badass"" while also getting the prowess from being related to him. 

[u]Legends in CK3[/u]
Legends of the dead gives you [b]FOUR[/b] types of legends. Heroic, saint, legitimacy and an unofficial ancestor one. 
Heroic gives you claims, saint converts your realm and legitimacy gives you legitimacy and ancestor let's you revive a dead culture. That's the long and the short of it. You get extra things like a special building slot and an artefact which are ok. The legend is not permanent and costs 1/4 of your income over five years to produce. During these five years you have little to no impact of what the ""legend"" will actually say. 

Most of the time the legend will be filled with what feels like ChatGPT gibberish of plagues, bandits and local lords. As such the legend description with the exception of some will feel the same. Conquering Byzantium, mending the Schism, dismantling the Papacy and restoring Rome legends were nearly indistinguishable from each other in my run. People also seem to have the memory of goldfish, legends like King Arthur which have been passed down from 12th century to today are seemingly forgotten within decades. Legends like King Arthur are also known worldwide and feature in the pop culture of nations thousands of kilometres from Wales. In CK3 you'll be lucky if the peasants in Rome even know who restored the empire because the legend can only expand to 501 baronies.

Legends are character-specific (No Legends that define your dynasty like CK2 Bloodlines) and while they can be inherited, they are not inherited by your heir, rather your legend goes to a arbitrarily-assigned dynasty member and frankly, I have no clue how the game decides who gets it. That's assuming you die soon enough for it to be inherited, since most legends deactivate after a few decades. Apparently single-handily stopping a viking invasion stops mattering after 20 years, and nobody cares if your father unified England and claimed descent from King Arthur.

Legitimacy is a complete joke. It's character-specific, not title specific, so the game does not care about the scenario the devs themselves pointed out (Whether or not a French warrior-prince should be considered the rightful ruler of Byzantium), as long as you were legitimate in whatever title you had before, you're legitimate in all of them. 

Also a sudden UI revamp that, while not that bad honestly, came out of nowhere and they replaced all the click sounds with a very annoying ""Sword unsheathe, sword sheath"" sound that grates on you very quickly. Again, nothing like this was mentioned in the dev diaries and there is currently no way to change it.

There is also none of the flavor additions that CK2's Reaper's Due DLC gave, such as multiple execution methods.

Paradox keeps on missing. They had a solid base in CK2 and instead of refining it or adapting it for CK3, they decided to get ''creative''. What they came up with falls short of anything they promised in the trailers and dev blogs.

- Legends disappear after 20-something years after being made. They don't require any specific actions unlike they did in CK2, essentially you pay once, and then wait for the map to be painted with ''your legend is spreading''
- More than half of the events that are supposed to increase legitimacy don't work, I've tried different events: tours, feasts, weddings, funerals, so on. Only feasts had an actual even that actually increased legitimacy.
- Legitimacy system in itself is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, you can have the same family ruling the kingdom/empire since the start of the game and some rulers will randomly start with legitimacy at max and others have it at maybe 1st or 2nd out of 5 levels.
- Plagues are nothing more than a nuisance and money sink for rebuilding efforts, and that's it. You'll see constant pop-ups ''Isolate yourself/capital'' each time any plague shows up on the  map. (A simple fix to that would be to make this option become an event ONLY when the plague reaches your personal domain - Paradox, take notes)"

Yet another DLC that adds new features that have a lot of promise, but needed significantly more development time to make them good. It seems like their business model these days is to create a barebones framework that the modders can finish for them.

I've played significantly more now and wow this DLC's new mechanics are a hot mess. I'll review it with the new free update.

1) Legitimacy. It's interesting, but not a single character starts with any levels of legitimacy, so the early game for everyone is just going to be a slog with needing to gain legitimacy

2) Diseases. oh diseases. This has been been something we have asked PDS to give us for several years now. It was a machochist's love from CK2, and now it's here, except now it's really annoying. diseases come every couple of years in random spots in the world, meaning if you're nearby any or you have a large empire, you're going to get event spammed with the same 3 events over and over and over again. the result from the events are never beneficial. they just happen. 

3) Legends. the big selling point and the thing actually on sale with this DLC is just ok. they're neat, but they are not spell/grammar checked at all, and are abusable. The AI will pursue legends, because why wouldn't you, and will often try to pay you to help spread the legend. but you spreading the legend costs gold per month to upkeep, so it really isn't worth your time much. so you can take their gold, and immediately stop promoting the legend. now if balance was a thing that existed, you might take a prestige hit, after all you just broke a deal? nope. maybe you lose some legitimacy, that cool new feature with this update? still no. ok, how about just an opinion hit? nope. It's free money, it's just free money. and that same character will try to pay you again a few months later, so we do the same thing again.
Legends spread from county to county based on who is spreading the legend and from a radius around where it originated, but there is a max to how far a legend can spread. The way it spreads is almost like a disease would spread, and that is probably why we got diseases in this update as well. Overall Legends are super underdeveloped and don't really add much to your gameplay

4) Funerals. Ah funerals the new activity you can do to gain legitimacy, lower stress, gain prestige, boost opinions, ... seduce someone, murder someone else. It's honestly a great activity. There's even an event during it where characters will reminisce on memories they have from the memories journal. except that characters don't generate memories of other characters at all, so the only thing they reminisce about them is when they declared war on them, slept with them, they died, or they killed them. most of the time they aren't even known as the killer. they just out themselves with a ""i killed him yeah""

This DLC is a super underdeveloped product and I genuinely cannot recommend this for $20. maybe try again when its on sale with a steep discount. and wait until it gets more patches to fix the glaring issues, which will probably never come."

But instead with this dlc, a legend only stays around for 100 years when you get it to mythical tier on the COUNTIES, not your dynasty. CK 2 did this much much better. No legend is permenant in this DLC. Legends should be completely permenant like how we know about King Arthur Pendragon to this day and how some dynasties in history claimed to be coming from them.

The Legends: A cool concept that give good rewards but are effectively a money sink. Range from a simple boost to development and skill boosts to ""you now have a claim to every independent title in Iberia"". The events around legends can be enjoyable but once you promote one legend to mythical status, you have seen all the events (and even your first time there can be repetition). My biggest complaint is that legends only last 20 years once completed, even though, especially if your pushing mythical, it can be a multi-generational effort, and unless you go all the way some of the rewards are RNG.

The dead: Imma be 100% funerals should have been part of the free update. The plagues are ok, adding to the chaos of the game and a more dynamic if intangible threat, and diseases are now actually scary at times. Havnt actually played long enough to see the black death so cant comment on it but from what I have seen from the community it seems pretty interesting, though you lose a absolute ton of development. Overall 7/10, you get whats on the tin.

Legitimacy: ok this is free update content but I need to rant somewhere, legitimacy is annoying. You lose way to much to plagues and losing a single battle but winning wars SOMETIMES give as much as back as losing a battle, but WINNING a battle outnumbered 3:1 does...nothing. Unless you do a legitimizing legend you can spend 50 years building up to level four, only for about 3-4 bad events in about the same amount of years knocks you to tier 3. And as for what tier is considered ""acceptable"" for your rank? Dont know, it bounced between 3-4 when I was a king, and always seemed to be where I was at least one level behind. Most of the advantages of high legitimacy are moot since unlike royal court each tier doesnt give benefits, only negates a penalty, while being over legitimacy is nigh impossible for kings who can actually make use of the bonuses like ""increased vassal acceptance chance"" but good luck maxing out the bar and keeping it for more then a year."

This DLC is a step back from the Bloodlines DLC from CK2 for the cost of the same price. Legends are limited, you can't even choose how to name your legend, it's always a random generic name tied to the legend unlocked and is not inherited by your dynasty, it's tied to counties which doesn't make sense since it's *your* legend, not the land's legend.

Legitimacy is a new mechanic tied to the legends feature, but you don't need the DLC to have this mechanic. If you are an usurper or startup ruler, you will have a slight struggle especially if your vassals are of different culture than you and your cultural acceptance is low. This mechanic adds a slight complexity on how vassals will accept your rule but overall not that impactful.

Plagues are another new mechanic added to the game which is basically also not that impactful since plague strength isn't that optimized even at full strength. You'll see ""casualties"" pertaining to the plague in question but it'll usually fizzle out before even killing 100 people, which is kinda underwhelming. I had to tell my court physician not to help with the plague so that I could actually experience the mechanic on my city. There are also no random events tied to plagues like not washing your hands after a hunt or falling into a latrine, causing a plague on your household if you have low learning, etc. Overall, plagues appear to be quite bland and just spams you with notifications of plagues that are just minor annoyances.

Let's get into fine details, shall we?

[h2]Plagues[/h2]

So, for the uninitiated, CK3 is a character-driven and focused RPG-meets-Sims game. Back when the game released 3 years ago, the design intent was to really invest into your characters, make them live long, have great education and congenital traits. The game really encouraged that with mechanics like Long/Short Reign, legacies like Octogenarians and Graceful Aging etc. However, a part of the community complained the game is not ""hardcore"" enough. As a result we got so called ""harm events"" in one of the updates, with the idea of randomly forcing death/crippling events on your characters and going completely against everything established previously. 

Plagues is the continuation of the trend. It adds the separate ""elderly heath"" stat to further cripple your characters beyond certain age, and otherwise all it does is randomly forces diseases on them. If previously my Rurik would live into his 60th - with this DLC he died in the early 50th from smallpox, and his son Helgi inherited at 27 and instantly got cancer. RIP. In the game where unplanned character death is akin to having your saves wiped it goes without saying how terrible these additions are. And the plagues are so constant that I eventually learned to live with them and ignore the constant buttons for ""Go into seclusion"" and ""Isolate the capital"" popping on my screen.

[h2]Legitimacy[/h2]

This mechanics is simple ""win more"" power creep that if you're a good player makes the game even easier and if you struggle makes it even worse for you. Win a few wars and do a feast and you notice it's easier to vassalize or make alliances. Lose a battle though, and you are hit with internal instability on top of that. Marry a beautiful lowborn girl and you're now hit with legitimacy penalty on top of the prestige one. The rising legitimacy expectations based on your rank are there to make it more difficult to keep kingdoms and empires together. However, this mechanics is superficial and in reality does little to change how the game is played. Like if you have the biggest army and the wealthiest domain around - you can pretty much forget legitimacy exists. 

[h2]Legends[/h2]

And this is a money sink. In the early game, maintaining and spreading a legend will cost you the money you could have spent on a large army, making it not really viable. And in the late game the rewards of the mechanics are pretty irrelevant. Imagine spending 3 legacy points to get a perk that grants your character a Saint trait, but you need to work for 100-200 years to complete a Mythic holy legend for it. The most important reward for legend completion are ""Legendary buildings"" - however those compete with existing Special buildings and Holy Sites for slots and end up being less powerful versions of those. This makes legends pointless if your domain is something like Paris or Rome, and while it could be useful if you want to make your domain in the middle of nowhere somewhat viable - you wouldn't have the funds to get it done in the first place. And the last reward is a book containing the legend (with random text which feels like written by ChatGPT) which only the character who completed the legend can commission for an additional sum of gold.

So there you have it - one mechanics that is harmful to the experience, one mechanics that is plain unnecessary, and one more that could be good if it wasn't half-baked and designed to be more than a money sink."

The pros are:

1) Plagues and Diseases are back. And they are a bit of fun.
2) It has some fun additions for Roleplaying purposes despite being more of a systemic pack.
3) The UI has gotten a lot better too. Espescially for some of the older mechanics as court positions.
4) While you could cheese Legitimacy and Legends it is more fun to let them run in a more role playing like style.

The cons are:

1) Legends could need more depth and there should be some more unique legends for many regions (Persia could need at least three more. Tibet also and why are things like the G√∂kturks not really a seed. I don't want to start with Africa).
2) Also there should be some ancestrial legends of your Dynasty in the late game.
3) The AI seems to have issues with legitimacy? I have the feel that they sometimes let it fall apart even with being able to avoid this situation.

For me it is a 7/10. It is not as good as Fate of Iberia or Tours and Tournaments and is a fine addition. Either get it in the Chaptr 3 Bundle or in a Sale as it is not amazing T&T or an all around good pack as Fate of Iberia.

I recommend buying it on sale or getting the bundle because Roads to Power seems like it will actually be great.

Granted, a fair share of the core returning plague mechanics are part of the free ""scythe"" update, only some extra elements and more expanded bits are part of the DLC pack related to the plague mechanics such as funerals, additional varieties in plagues, more fleshed out Black Death. 

However the 2nd focus those being legends which sounded like about the same what we had with bloodlines in CK2's final update fall kinda flat due one major issue, there is no way extend a legend , legends you create for your character and dynasti fade away in mere years which makes no sense, this is an issue that honestly can very easily be fixed by simply increasing somewhat how long a legend can exist and adding some simple additional mechanic in which future generation can keep the family legends going and have them always be inherited. 

Due to to the issue of the bizarrely short legends, a lot of people who unlike me maybe weren't mainly excited for the plagues but instead for the legends mechanic were let down thus , this has dropped to mixed reviews but since i am someone who primarily was excited and focused on the plagues returning, the legends stuff was more of an extra side thing for me so it didn't bum me out when it turned out it has this weird design flaw that i do hope will be fixed.

So due to this, i am still really happy, i was so excited to see dynamic plagues and diseases come back , though i would suggest waiting for a bit of a discount on this DLC, it's more worth it for like 15 bucks, maybe a tad less, i did get mine from a 3rd party store where they had a slight discount dropping it to 15 which felt more fair then these bizzare new awful prices they hiked up for CK3 DLC a year or so ago.

Reading a lot of the negative reviews, it seems like people want to be negative for the sake of being negative.  I keep reading about the ‚Äúoverpriced‚Äù DLC, but people forget that half of the expansion was free.  Yes, free meaning that you didn‚Äôt have to pay anything for it.  I see review after review for Legends of the Dead for people who have played 0.0 hours in the last two weeks.  If you‚Äôve played 0.0 hours in the last two weeks as of 10 March, that means you‚Äôve played 0.0 hours of Legends of the Dead, including the free parts.

Are there some rough edges for Legends of the Dead?  Yes.  Did Paradox have to do a patch after going live to fix an issue?  Yes.  Did Legends of the dead (The DLC not just the free expansion) change the game?  Yes it did.   Was Legends of the Dead as good as Bloodlines from Crusader Kings II?  I don‚Äôt know, that‚Äôs a very subjective question, but is Legends of the Dead worth $19.99?  Absolutely.  Without a doubt.  Absolutely."

I think the plague mechanics are fine, though the base system was added to the main game for free, so really you're just paying for a few extra potential negative modifiers, names of plagues, and one RNG event chain. Legitimacy is pretty interesting as well and makes the game more challenging by giving you more penalties for trying to marry Genius peasants into your bloodline. But, once again legitimacy was added to the base game for free so it's not something you're paying for. They're starting to add ""Sub-tasks"" that your court positions like the Physician can do, which is great and gives the player more control over their court, but once again that's free with the base game.

So, if most of the major features of the DLC are actually free with the base game, what do you get here? A couple of RNG event chains, a handful of new clothes, the ability to hold funerals, and Legends. Legends feels like something thrown together at the last second to justify this being a major update and ""Major"" DLC instead of a major update and minor DLC. Through the mechanic of ""Legends"" players are now supposed to be able to create lasting legends for their dynasty that make you out to be a hero, legitimize your dynasty's right to rule, or turn you into a saint among men. That all sounds great on paper, but in reality Legends are little more than an RNG gold sink. You have no real power over what your legend is about, what deeds it promotes, or what the final story will be, in fact the final legend feels like chatGPT was fed every memory of my character and then forced to spit out the most mundane drivel it could think of. 
""Here's the legend of how kind Midas walked two counties over to visit a church."" Meanwhile in my lifetime I united an entire kingdom and drove out a massive plague. The rewards for creating a Legend include an ok artifact, and a ""Legendary"" building. These legendary buildings compete for existing duchy buildings and are generally simply on par with what you can already build though they do have some nice models for the buildings. 
To top it off legends are not a permanent thing despite all the effort that goes into building them. Depending on how much money and effort you sunk into a legend it will stick around for between 20 and 100 years. That's right, you can create a ""Legend"" and still be alive when everyone has forgotten all about it. King Arthur who? Saint Edward, never heard of him. Now, I could see legends needing upkeep if the rewards were truly powerful, and the need to erase or supersede a legend to create a new one, but the fact that they're called LEGENDS and are forgotten in less than a generation is terrible design and it makes it feel pretty bad creating them.
CK2 already did legends better, they were called bloodlines. The devs need to take a look back at what they already did and improve upon it instead of creating worse, less interesting features.

I hope that the community's comments will be listened to and that this problem will be solved, if not by Paradox then at least by the community itself (thanks to all the modders out there btw, you truly are the best that mankind can offer) which would save us again from a mechanic created and promptly abandoned.

So the plague system is basically Reapers DLC from CK2; diseases and plagues are more deadly and have more consequences, which is excellent.

Unfortunately, the Legends system is poorly implemented; legends are costly to maintain yet do not last very long; aside from the most important legitimacy gain, there really isn't any reason to interact with the Legends system. 
As mentioned, Legends lasts a very short while after it's completed, and without dynastic interaction or any interaction with conquered land, the legends mechanic feels really hollow and shallow a system.

Legitimacy itself is also not anything interesting. Firstly, legitimacy gives buffs and debuffs, but does not affect the way claims are pushed if anything it feels more like short reign and long reign debuff and buff, respectively and feels redundant with the way it is implemented. 

Secondly the easiest way to gain legitimacy is through warfare, as other activities such as feasts, tours and weddinngs etc. are very costly. This now discourages play styles do not involve warfare, for example diplomacy and intrigue play styles will generate little to no legitimacy which almost guarantees that you will have to play the game with a major debuff.

 
Overall the legends and Legitimacy mechanic has a lot of potential and perhaps in the future there would be a touch up on this DLC to smooth out the implementation of the mechanics.

I‚Äôve had rulers that had their capital plagued 5 times before they even turned 40 years old, and i‚Äôve seen ireland turn into a desert with 0 development on the late start-date because they were hit near constantly by plagues with nothing to defend themselves.

The legends are really quite stale. On top of that it's weird that you build up the legend yourself, as if a legend is some sort of ""top down"" thing in our world, rather than a story that gets passed around a community until it becomes something more than whatever event touched it off. I understand this is a video game, and that it is a representation of the world rather than a mirror of it, but this is so awkward and false in its execution, in its logic, that I cannot look past it. 

Legitimacy, a new mechanic meant to reflect how your community/realm views you, seems like a great idea at the start. Except there really was a mechanic for it already, in your relationship to individual characters. Legitimacy is, by a modern definition, the personal belief in the authority of a figure or an institution. Now instead of your character having a personal relationship with every other character, and that reflecting their individual loyalties to you as a ruler, their opinion is collated into a monolithic bar that you must seek to fill with video game points. 

Again, it is a reflection of a reality, rather than a mirror, but there was already a much better reflection in the game. One that was far more subtle. 

In truth this betrays an even greater problem with the game. What is the difference between authority and power? Power is the ability to make someone do something through threat of violence. Authority is the ability to command someone righteously. The Catholic Church, as portrayed in the game, is barely an entity. In reality, in the Middle Ages, it was the authoritative institution of the West. 

To have any legitimacy in a ruler, in a representation of the Christian West, the Church must be the authority to dispense that legitimacy. 

Feasts and hunts and fine robes do not a King make. Not in this place and this time period (or ever really). The authority of such things has to be lodged in something more than the material world. It has to come from a metaphysical ideal. In that regard, CK3 is like a scientific treatise. It proffers a neutral, sterilized view of the world in which the only recognized legitimacy at all is the ability and willingness to use violence to get what you want.

Legitimacy is centered around a character, and not around title, which renders the whole thing completely useless, apart from being a minor modifier. 
Also some of the rewards for completing a legend (e.g. legendary artifact commission) require your legend to be present, first of all legends disappear COMPLETELY without trace after two decades at most, and when you use your legendary adventure casus belli before creating the artifact, and go somewhere remote, you will never be able to complete that artifact. It happened to me and I am still mad about it.
Plagues are interesting, and definitely add a much needed threat for the player - but it still feels like it could have been better, and IMO outbreaks seem to be biased to happen in the player's territory, or at least in close proximity.
On top of that, full of bugs, and it's a shame that this is the expected standard by now from Paradox.

Also, minor detail, but, on release day, in the Developer Livestream there was a question from the community if Isolationist cultures get a bonus to plague resistance, which was affirmed by a Dev, but in the game, if this is true, there is no indicator for it in the cultural tradition. I doubt they actually implemented it. Could be a honest mistake, or could be an indicator for greater issues at Paradox.

I have tried to be as optimistic and fair as possible but I just cannot understand the praise this DLC gets from the community. Compare it to Bloodlines in CK2 and it's just a pure joke.

Summing up, I cannot recommend it in this state. And I am starting to lose my excitement for Roads to Power, which sounded really cool to me initially."

This DLC is not substandard, it is not terribly unbalanced or anything like that. It is simply... meh. Legends fade way too quickly, you would think the exalted among men emperor of the newly restored Roman Empire, who claims to be the son of a lynx and visited by god would be something remembered forever in the annuals of history? Nope, in about two generations literally everybody has forgotten about him- Not even a mention of his name. The legends are generic too which really doesn't help the situation. The best example of this is Ottar ""Die Vogel"" of house Babenberger, a legendary ruler who restored the Holy Roman Empire from a mere county in Wien, destroying his enemies and launching grand holy wars into England, overrun by heathens. 

This sounds awesome right? Something mentioned in his legend ""Battle of Cumberland"" the battle which decided the fate of Scotland, England and Ireland? Nope, the legend mentions how he visited Canterbury and some generic event where he is 'visited by god' which is actually just a 100 year old randomly generated lowborn character, it doesn't even get the details of the battle itself correct, Ottar had no reinforcements or aid from anybody, his snake-like Karling allies refusing to aid him in his noble quest for Christendom... yet it says here how the battle was nearly lost (which is correct until a battle roll went in his favour) until his horsemen (the only men at arms unit I hadn't invested in) smashed through the enemy Varangian heavy infantry... a unit that counters heavy horsemen.

The legends in short are painfully generic, nothing unique about them exists. All the origin legends detail about how you were born from a pool of Ragnarr Lothbrok or Arthur Pendragon's own 'flesh and blood'. Cool, until you see it again, and again, and again and then some more halfway across the world. These origin legends are pretty much exclusive to Europe too, nothing in Persia claiming to be from the ages of Darius, nothing in Greece about Alexander the GREAT, nothing about Genghis Khan after he falls, imagine how cool that would be? Nope.

To conclude, all the legends feel like they were written by chat GPT, nothing unique or interesting about them, to add insult to injury, Ottar's statue didn't even have his name on it, just generic flavour text about a ruler immortalized in stone. His legend faded and in 2 generations, the legendary ruler of the HRE, destroyer of heathens, incredible commander and wily as a hawk had faded into complete obscurity, the only reminder of his existence being a small statue in Cumberland with a popular opinion boost.

This DLC is a for sure buy when it is on SALE, otherwise, it has nothing of value to add to this game. I hope the next one is a bit better.

It really feels like a much, much worse version of bloodlines to me.

Legitimacy feels very poorly balanced and overall just punitive and removing of more player agency over their realm. Perhaps there can be a proper balancing of it but it really feels far more stick than carrot. The legitimacy hits from disinheriting for example are needlessly expensive, especially when it's having secondary children take the vows...

legends are the most half baked feature to come out of ck3 yet. even court artefact spamming has some level of interaction with it, but legends are truly awful. its start legend, wait for a bit, mindlessly click through event spam about it (I have seen the same event 4 separate times in the same playthrough for multiple events), click button to upgrade, repeat this step again, then click complete, get some generic bonuses or some region specific claims, and now you can never use this legend again for the rest of the game. 

that's right, in a game about dynastic succession, about seeing how each character's actions build onto each other, only one character in your entire dynasty can use a legend seed. according to this dlc, if Louis the stammerer claimed to be the decedent of Charlemagne, none of his line afterwards could EVER claim the same again. the biggest middle finger to the player? after all is said and done, and you complete your so called 'legend', not only does it die off the map completely in just a few decades, but you cant even read the chronicle. that's right, the devs who claim this is a role-playing game as an excuse for giving us barely any mechanics besides event spam for 3 years, have the main role-play feature of their new dlc straight up disappear from player view almost instantly.
 
the common sense way to do this is have legends actually affect your dynasty long term, and give them a set of standards to adhere too to appear more like their claimed ancestor. If you want people to see you as the heir of Charlemagne, defeat the Saracens in battle, have a group of famed knights who you ride into battle with, be crowned by the pope, defeat rebellious vassals, etc. if you fail at these things, people will see you as not living up to your claimed ancestry, giving worse penalties then failing these things normally. the worst part is that most of these issues cant be fixed by modding. I have looked into (and posted) a mod that tries to fix legends, but with how fundamentally flawed the system at its core, a mod can only put a bandied on the bullet wound.

plagues are pretty solid, if deadly (as they should be to an extent), but could have used a bit more depth which they could have gotten if resources were not wasted on the abysmal legends system. pretty self explanatory tbh, if you have played ck2, they are not too different

as for bugs, I have noticed some with the new sound effects (which im not a fan of compared to the old), and some bigger ones, like a random unlanded character occupying land for some inexplicable reason.

overall legends are awful, being yet another event spam coated with an unintuitive ui over it, and the additions the dlc gives to plagues are not worth it, as most of the new plague mechanics are base game. skip if you didn't buy chapter 3, and if you were like me and got blinded by byzantine empire and landless hype and instantly clicked buy on chapter 3, lets pray that they make up for this. ck3 cant (or rather shouldn't) survive another year of disappointments like the last few."

76561199015144202,2671060,False,0.956526696681976318,"Sadly, most of the content is badly designed RNG.

Personally i deem procedurally generated content to be a great way of increasing the variation and the longevity of content within a game.

However; if not enough care is taken to properly, and logically, integrate such content within a game this content can be very distracting, bad, and non-immersive.

The inclusion of legends could be grand for the game. To experience how your deeds not only influence the world, but also the tales told about your dynasty within it would be amazingly immersive. To see how bards, and sometimes you, twist truth into a more exciting form could be fun.

But sadly, legends fall under the category of badly procedurally generated content.

Take the following example:

My ruler was King Dumnarth of Cornwall. One of my favorite starts in 867, btw. It¬¥s fun to enter the fight for britain as a brythonic ruler.

King Dumnarth conquered the neighboring duchies of Wessex and Hwicce rather easily. And then, in a bid to increase his legitimacy and gather some prestige, he started spreading the legend that he and his line are descended from King Arthur.

While doing so Britanny was conquered by a norse Adventurer. King Dumnarth set sail in order to conquer free his bretic brethren from the Heathens. He won some great victories and drove them off, adding Britanny to his Demesne.

Then he proclaimed the Kingdom of Dumnonia. (Via the found a new kingdom decision, not the restore the kingdom of cornwall one.)

In gameplay terms this wasn¬¥t that much. In in-universe terms, though, this was something rather significant. A major victory against the Norse invaders was won and a new bretic kingdom, spanning the channel, formed.

This is the stuff of legends! What better to support his claim of descent from King Arthur, than to prove such undertakings!

However, it isn¬¥t reflected in the legend. At all.

The Legend fails in two ways, both the result of badly procedurally generated content. Content which is completely random, without being integrated in a sensible manner.

1.) It doesn¬¥t tie into the King Arthur myth at all. Arthur is mentioned once, but aside from this- nothing. It doesn¬¥t tie into this claim logically. A basic way this could, and has been done, would be to claim descent from him. Or to claim to have performed similiar feats. (Being visited by Merlin, finding excalibur, something.)

Instead the non-sensical claim of being birthed from a pool of blood and flesh is given. Yeah. Even though many people still alive in his kingdom will have known his parents. The same claim can be found in many other generated legends.

2.) It doesn¬¥t properly take into account which deeds of his have been noteworthy. I don¬¥t know how the selection works- If simply some deeds are eligible and some not, or if purely some random ones are chosen- But in this legend it didn¬¥t deign to mention his conquest of brittany and the victory over heathen invaders, nor does it mention the founding of a new kingdom.

Instead it chose to mention that one time he rode to some church, two baronies away from the border of his kingdom.

This isn¬¥t a fictionalised story of my character. This is [PICK RANDOM TEXT 1] + [PICK RANDOM TEXT 2] + [PICK RANDOM MEMORY FROM ROOT_CHARACTER].

Plagues and new disease mechanics: Mostly part of the free patch and  as far as I can tell basically lifted 1:1 from CK2 and the parts that are part of the DLC are sold back to players at an insane price, despite the assertions from Paradox that they were going to take time to put thought into new systems and mechanics to expand the game past what existed in CK2 - at least characters actually die now though this entire change now continues the trend of adding more and more costs to the game with no way to supplement income the game is still functioning on the basic economy system from CK2 a game that is almost 15 years old

Legitimacy: A shoehorned system that just adds further hoops to jump through to keep vassals in line seems mostly designed to encourage people to use the horrible and repetitive hold court feature from Royal Court the other horrible content release for CK3 - just another random stat you have to manage to keep people from rebelling ever few years and even when you do manage it the system only serves to force you to play in one way

[u]Bloodlines in CK2[/u]
Bloodlines were not only more dynamic but also more fun to collect. One of my favourite things to do in Ck2 was to consolidate bloodlines through intricate breeding projects. It needed planning, patience, determination and knowledge of different game mechanics. If you did not start with a bloodline you also had the option to set an ambition to create one. These created bloodlines could vary [b]wildly[/b], from peaceful ruler to bloodthirsty murderer and gave permanent modifiers that corresponded with the type of bloodline. There were in total [b]THIRTY+[/b] unique bloodlines the player could create. These were great for RP and gameplay. You could look back at your ancestor and go, ""Damn that guy that got the warrior lodge bloodline was a badass"" while also getting the prowess from being related to him. 

[u]Legends in CK3[/u]
Legends of the dead gives you [b]FOUR[/b] types of legends. Heroic, saint, legitimacy and an unofficial ancestor one. 
Heroic gives you claims, saint converts your realm and legitimacy gives you legitimacy and ancestor let's you revive a dead culture. That's the long and the short of it. You get extra things like a special building slot and an artefact which are ok. The legend is not permanent and costs 1/4 of your income over five years to produce. During these five years you have little to no impact of what the ""legend"" will actually say. 

Most of the time the legend will be filled with what feels like ChatGPT gibberish of plagues, bandits and local lords. As such the legend description with the exception of some will feel the same. Conquering Byzantium, mending the Schism, dismantling the Papacy and restoring Rome legends were nearly indistinguishable from each other in my run. People also seem to have the memory of goldfish, legends like King Arthur which have been passed down from 12th century to today are seemingly forgotten within decades. Legends like King Arthur are also known worldwide and feature in the pop culture of nations thousands of kilometres from Wales. In CK3 you'll be lucky if the peasants in Rome even know who restored the empire because the legend can only expand to 501 baronies.

Legends are character-specific (No Legends that define your dynasty like CK2 Bloodlines) and while they can be inherited, they are not inherited by your heir, rather your legend goes to a arbitrarily-assigned dynasty member and frankly, I have no clue how the game decides who gets it. That's assuming you die soon enough for it to be inherited, since most legends deactivate after a few decades. Apparently single-handily stopping a viking invasion stops mattering after 20 years, and nobody cares if your father unified England and claimed descent from King Arthur.

Legitimacy is a complete joke. It's character-specific, not title specific, so the game does not care about the scenario the devs themselves pointed out (Whether or not a French warrior-prince should be considered the rightful ruler of Byzantium), as long as you were legitimate in whatever title you had before, you're legitimate in all of them. 

Also a sudden UI revamp that, while not that bad honestly, came out of nowhere and they replaced all the click sounds with a very annoying ""Sword unsheathe, sword sheath"" sound that grates on you very quickly.

- Legends disappear after 20-something years after being made. They don't require any specific actions unlike they did in CK2, essentially you pay once, and then wait for the map to be painted with ''your legend is spreading''
- More than half of the events that are supposed to increase legitimacy don't work, I've tried different events: tours, feasts, weddings, funerals, so on. Only feasts had an actual even that actually increased legitimacy.
- Legitimacy system in itself is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, you can have the same family ruling the kingdom/empire since the start of the game and some rulers will randomly start with legitimacy at max and others have it at maybe 1st or 2nd out of 5 levels.
- Plagues are nothing more than a nuisance and money sink for rebuilding efforts, and that's it. You'll see constant pop-ups ''Isolate yourself/capital'' each time any plague shows up on the  map.

Yet another DLC that adds new features that have a lot of promise, but needed significantly more development time to make them good. It seems like their business model these days is to create a barebones framework that the modders can finish for them.

I've played significantly more now and wow this DLC's new mechanics are a hot mess. I'll review it with the new free update.

1) Legitimacy. It's interesting, but not a single character starts with any levels of legitimacy, so the early game for everyone is just going to be a slog with needing to gain legitimacy

2) Diseases. oh diseases. This has been been something we have asked PDS to give us for several years now. It was a machochist's love from CK2, and now it's here, except now it's really annoying. diseases come every couple of years in random spots in the world, meaning if you're nearby any or you have a large empire, you're going to get event spammed with the same 3 events over and over and over again. the result from the events are never beneficial. they just happen. 

3) Legends. the big selling point and the thing actually on sale with this DLC is just ok. they're neat, but they are not spell/grammar checked at all, and are abusable. The AI will pursue legends, because why wouldn't you, and will often try to pay you to help spread the legend. but you spreading the legend costs gold per month to upkeep, so it really isn't worth your time much. so you can take their gold, and immediately stop promoting the legend. now if balance was a thing that existed, you might take a prestige hit, after all you just broke a deal? nope. maybe you lose some legitimacy, that cool new feature with this update? still no. ok, how about just an opinion hit? nope. It's free money, it's just free money. and that same character will try to pay you again a few months later, so we do the same thing again.
Legends spread from county to county based on who is spreading the legend and from a radius around where it originated, but there is a max to how far a legend can spread. The way it spreads is almost like a disease would spread, and that is probably why we got diseases in this update as well. Overall Legends are super underdeveloped and don't really add much to your gameplay

4) Funerals. Ah funerals the new activity you can do to gain legitimacy, lower stress, gain prestige, boost opinions, ... seduce someone, murder someone else. It's honestly a great activity. There's even an event during it where characters will reminisce on memories they have from the memories journal. except that characters don't generate memories of other characters at all, so the only thing they reminisce about them is when they declared war on them, slept with them, they died, or they killed them. most of the time they aren't even known as the killer. they just out themselves with a ""i killed him yeah""

The Legends: A cool concept that give good rewards but are effectively a money sink. Range from a simple boost to development and skill boosts to ""you now have a claim to every independent title in Iberia"". The events around legends can be enjoyable but once you promote one legend to mythical status, you have seen all the events (and even your first time there can be repetition). My biggest complaint is that legends only last 20 years once completed, even though, especially if your pushing mythical, it can be a multi-generational effort, and unless you go all the way some of the rewards are RNG.

The dead: Imma be 100% funerals should have been part of the free update. The plagues are ok, adding to the chaos of the game and a more dynamic if intangible threat, and diseases are now actually scary at times. Havnt actually played long enough to see the black death so cant comment on it but from what I have seen from the community it seems pretty interesting, though you lose a absolute ton of development. Overall 7/10, you get whats on the tin.

Legitimacy: ok this is free update content but I need to rant somewhere, legitimacy is annoying. You lose way to much to plagues and losing a single battle but winning wars SOMETIMES give as much as back as losing a battle, but WINNING a battle outnumbered 3:1 does...nothing. Unless you do a legitimizing legend you can spend 50 years building up to level four, only for about 3-4 bad events in about the same amount of years knocks you to tier 3. And as for what tier is considered ""acceptable"" for your rank? Dont know, it bounced between 3-4 when I was a king, and always seemed to be where I was at least one level behind. Most of the advantages of high legitimacy are moot since unlike royal court each tier doesnt give benefits, only negates a penalty, while being over legitimacy is nigh impossible for kings who can actually make use of the bonuses like ""increased vassal acceptance chance"" but good luck maxing out the bar and keeping it for more then a year."

This DLC is a step back from the Bloodlines DLC from CK2 for the cost of the same price. Legends are limited, you can't even choose how to name your legend, it's always a random generic name tied to the legend unlocked and is not inherited by your dynasty, it's tied to counties which doesn't make sense since it's *your* legend, not the land's legend.

Legitimacy is a new mechanic tied to the legends feature, but you don't need the DLC to have this mechanic. If you are an usurper or startup ruler, you will have a slight struggle especially if your vassals are of different culture than you and your cultural acceptance is low. This mechanic adds a slight complexity on how vassals will accept your rule but overall not that impactful.

Plagues are another new mechanic added to the game which is basically also not that impactful since plague strength isn't that optimized even at full strength. You'll see ""casualties"" pertaining to the plague in question but it'll usually fizzle out before even killing 100 people, which is kinda underwhelming. I had to tell my court physician not to help with the plague so that I could actually experience the mechanic on my city. There are also no random events tied to plagues like not washing your hands after a hunt or falling into a latrine, causing a plague on your household if you have low learning, etc. Overall, plagues appear to be quite bland and just spams you with notifications of plagues that are just minor annoyances.

Let's get into fine details, shall we?

[h2]Plagues[/h2]

So, for the uninitiated, CK3 is a character-driven and focused RPG-meets-Sims game. Back when the game released 3 years ago, the design intent was to really invest into your characters, make them live long, have great education and congenital traits. The game really encouraged that with mechanics like Long/Short Reign, legacies like Octogenarians and Graceful Aging etc. However, a part of the community complained the game is not ""hardcore"" enough. As a result we got so called ""harm events"" in one of the updates, with the idea of randomly forcing death/crippling events on your characters and going completely against everything established previously. 

Plagues is the continuation of the trend. It adds the separate ""elderly heath"" stat to further cripple your characters beyond certain age, and otherwise all it does is randomly forces diseases on them. If previously my Rurik would live into his 60th - with this DLC he died in the early 50th from smallpox, and his son Helgi inherited at 27 and instantly got cancer. RIP. In the game where unplanned character death is akin to having your saves wiped it goes without saying how terrible these additions are. And the plagues are so constant that I eventually learned to live with them and ignore the constant buttons for ""Go into seclusion"" and ""Isolate the capital"" popping on my screen.

[h2]Legitimacy[/h2]

This mechanics is simple ""win more"" power creep that if you're a good player makes the game even easier and if you struggle makes it even worse for you. Win a few wars and do a feast and you notice it's easier to vassalize or make alliances. Lose a battle though, and you are hit with internal instability on top of that. Marry a beautiful lowborn girl and you're now hit with legitimacy penalty on top of the prestige one. The rising legitimacy expectations based on your rank are there to make it more difficult to keep kingdoms and empires together. However, this mechanics is superficial and in reality does little to change how the game is played. Like if you have the biggest army and the wealthiest domain around - you can pretty much forget legitimacy exists. 

[h2]Legends[/h2]

And this is a money sink. In the early game, maintaining and spreading a legend will cost you the money you could have spent on a large army, making it not really viable. And in the late game the rewards of the mechanics are pretty irrelevant. Imagine spending 3 legacy points to get a perk that grants your character a Saint trait, but you need to work for 100-200 years to complete a Mythic holy legend for it. The most important reward for legend completion are ""Legendary buildings"" - however those compete with existing Special buildings and Holy Sites for slots and end up being less powerful versions of those. This makes legends pointless if your domain is something like Paris or Rome, and while it could be useful if you want to make your domain in the middle of nowhere somewhat viable - you wouldn't have the funds to get it done in the first place. And the last reward is a book containing the legend (with random text which feels like written by ChatGPT) which only the character who completed the legend can commission for an additional sum of gold.

So there you have it - one mechanics that is harmful to the experience, one mechanics that is plain unnecessary, and one more that could be good if it wasn't half-baked and designed to be more than a money sink."

76561198114803179,2671060,True,0.648114025592803955,"Well. For me it is a decent addition. The additions of the Patch itself outweighs the addtitions of the DLC itself.

The pros are:

1) Plagues and Diseases are back. And they are a bit of fun.
2) It has some fun additions for Roleplaying purposes despite being more of a systemic pack.
3) The UI has gotten a lot better too. Espescially for some of the older mechanics as court positions.
4) While you could cheese Legitimacy and Legends it is more fun to let them run in a more role playing like style.

The cons are:

1) Legends could need more depth and there should be some more unique legends for many regions (Persia could need at least three more. Tibet also and why are things like the G√∂kturks not really a seed. I don't want to start with Africa).
2) Also there should be some ancestrial legends of your Dynasty in the late game.
3) The AI seems to have issues with legitimacy? I have the feel that they sometimes let it fall apart even with being able to avoid this situation.

For me it is a 7/10. It is not as good as Fate of Iberia or Tours and Tournaments and is a fine addition. Either get it in the Chaptr 3 Bundle or in a Sale as it is not amazing T&T or an all around good pack as Fate of Iberia.

I recommend buying it on sale or getting the bundle because Roads to Power seems like it will actually be great.

Onto Legends and Legitimacy.

Granted, a fair share of the core returning plague mechanics are part of the free ""scythe"" update, only some extra elements and more expanded bits are part of the DLC pack related to the plague mechanics such as funerals, additional varieties in plagues, more fleshed out Black Death. 

However the 2nd focus those being legends which sounded like about the same what we had with bloodlines in CK2's final update fall kinda flat due one major issue, there is no way extend a legend , legends you create for your character and dynasti fade away in mere years which makes no sense, this is an issue that honestly can very easily be fixed by simply increasing somewhat how long a legend can exist and adding some simple additional mechanic in which future generation can keep the family legends going and have them always be inherited. 

Due to to the issue of the bizarrely short legends, a lot of people who unlike me maybe weren't mainly excited for the plagues but instead for the legends mechanic were let down thus , this has dropped to mixed reviews but since i am someone who primarily was excited and focused on the plagues returning, the legends stuff was more of an extra side thing for me so it didn't bum me out when it turned out it has this weird design flaw that i do hope will be fixed.

So due to this, i am still really happy, i was so excited to see dynamic plagues and diseases come back , though i would suggest waiting for a bit of a discount on this DLC, it's more worth it for like 15 bucks, maybe a tad less, i did get mine from a 3rd party store where they had a slight discount dropping it to 15 which felt more fair then these bizzare new awful prices they hiked up for CK3 DLC a year or so ago.

I think the plague mechanics are fine, though the base system was added to the main game for free, so really you're just paying for a few extra potential negative modifiers, names of plagues, and one RNG event chain. Legitimacy is pretty interesting as well and makes the game more challenging by giving you more penalties for trying to marry Genius peasants into your bloodline. But, once again legitimacy was added to the base game for free so it's not something you're paying for. They're starting to add ""Sub-tasks"" that your court positions like the Physician can do, which is great and gives the player more control over their court, but once again that's free with the base game.

So, if most of the major features of the DLC are actually free with the base game, what do you get here? A couple of RNG event chains, a handful of new clothes, the ability to hold funerals, and Legends. Legends feels like something thrown together at the last second to justify this being a major update and ""Major"" DLC instead of a major update and minor DLC. Through the mechanic of ""Legends"" players are now supposed to be able to create lasting legends for their dynasty that make you out to be a hero, legitimize your dynasty's right to rule, or turn you into a saint among men. That all sounds great on paper, but in reality Legends are little more than an RNG gold sink. You have no real power over what your legend is about, what deeds it promotes, or what the final story will be, in fact the final legend feels like chatGPT was fed every memory of my character and then forced to spit out the most mundane drivel it could think of. 
""Here's the legend of how kind Midas walked two counties over to visit a church."" Meanwhile in my lifetime I united an entire kingdom and drove out a massive plague. The rewards for creating a Legend include an ok artifact, and a ""Legendary"" building. These legendary buildings compete for existing duchy buildings and are generally simply on par with what you can already build though they do have some nice models for the buildings. 
To top it off legends are not a permanent thing despite all the effort that goes into building them. Depending on how much money and effort you sunk into a legend it will stick around for between 20 and 100 years. That's right, you can create a ""Legend"" and still be alive when everyone has forgotten all about it. King Arthur who? Saint Edward, never heard of him. Now, I could see legends needing upkeep if the rewards were truly powerful, and the need to erase or supersede a legend to create a new one, but the fact that they're called LEGENDS and are forgotten in less than a generation is terrible design and it makes it feel pretty bad creating them.
CK2 already did legends better, they were called bloodlines. The devs need to take a look back at what they already did and improve upon it instead of creating worse, less interesting features.

I hope that the community's comments will be listened to and that this problem will be solved, if not by Paradox then at least by the community itself (thanks to all the modders out there btw, you truly are the best that mankind can offer) which would save us again from a mechanic created and promptly abandoned. The part concerning the plagues is very fun and makes the game more difficult to predict, even if for now the only real danger that manages to escape from the hands of the court physician is the black death. Oh true, I was forgetting to talk about legitimacy, but only because I had actually forgotten that it existed. Yet another mechanic with so much potential, but too timid to be taken seriously. I'm sure that if the developers release patches to improve all these problems, possibly listening to the community, this dlc could become really interesting and replayable, but for now it's just a disappointment, if not even a mockery considering that it costs ‚Ç¨20, a price a little too high to have a single fun mechanic and two totally forgettable ones."

So the plague system is basically Reapers DLC from CK2; diseases and plagues are more deadly and have more consequences, which is excellent.

Unfortunately, the Legends system is poorly implemented; legends are costly to maintain yet do not last very long; aside from the most important legitimacy gain, there really isn't any reason to interact with the Legends system. 
As mentioned, Legends lasts a very short while after it's completed, and without dynastic interaction or any interaction with conquered land, the legends mechanic feels really hollow and shallow a system.

Legitimacy itself is also not anything interesting. Firstly, legitimacy gives buffs and debuffs, but does not affect the way claims are pushed if anything it feels more like short reign and long reign debuff and buff, respectively and feels redundant with the way it is implemented. 

Secondly the easiest way to gain legitimacy is through warfare, as other activities such as feasts, tours and weddinngs etc. are very costly. This now discourages play styles do not involve warfare, for example diplomacy and intrigue play styles will generate little to no legitimacy which almost guarantees that you will have to play the game with a major debuff.

 
Overall the legends and Legitimacy mechanic has a lot of potential and perhaps in the future there would be a touch up on this DLC to smooth out the implementation of the mechanics.
As it stands right now, you would be better off buying this DLC when there is a sale"

I‚Äôve had rulers that had their capital plagued 5 times before they even turned 40 years old, and i‚Äôve seen ireland turn into a desert with 0 development on the late start-date because they were hit near constantly by plagues with nothing to defend themselves.

Legitimacy has been the most awful thing i‚Äôve seen so far, where none of the already existing events and dialogues affect it at all, but the newly added funeral gives you absolute tons of it.
Why even hold feasts when you can marry an old lady and go to her funeral as soon as she dies. The whole system makes no sense anymore. And the fact that you getting his by plagues every week drops your legitimacy too fast for you to do anything anyways.

The legends are really quite stale. On top of that it's weird that you build up the legend yourself, as if a legend is some sort of ""top down"" thing in our world, rather than a story that gets passed around a community until it becomes something more than whatever event touched it off. I understand this is a video game, and that it is a representation of the world rather than a mirror of it, but this is so awkward and false in its execution, in its logic, that I cannot look past it. 

Legitimacy, a new mechanic meant to reflect how your community/realm views you, seems like a great idea at the start. Except there really was a mechanic for it already, in your relationship to individual characters. Legitimacy is, by a modern definition, the personal belief in the authority of a figure or an institution. Now instead of your character having a personal relationship with every other character, and that reflecting their individual loyalties to you as a ruler, their opinion is collated into a monolithic bar that you must seek to fill with video game points. 

Again, it is a reflection of a reality, rather than a mirror, but there was already a much better reflection in the game. One that was far more subtle. 

In truth this betrays an even greater problem with the game. What is the difference between authority and power? Power is the ability to make someone do something through threat of violence. Authority is the ability to command someone righteously. The Catholic Church, as portrayed in the game, is barely an entity. In reality, in the Middle Ages, it was the authoritative institution of the West. 

To have any legitimacy in a ruler, in a representation of the Christian West, the Church must be the authority to dispense that legitimacy. 

Feasts and hunts and fine robes do not a King make. Not in this place and this time period (or ever really). The authority of such things has to be lodged in something more than the material world. It has to come from a metaphysical ideal. In that regard, CK3 is like a scientific treatise. It proffers a neutral, sterilized view of the world in which the only recognized legitimacy at all is the ability and willingness to use violence to get what you want.

You are meant to get legitimacy by going to war and doing events but while between 0-100 you only sometimes get legitimacy going to war and about 10 for an event so good luck spamming feasts and hunts for 30 years and hope you can get out of the death spiral.
Finally the worst thing to come from this is certain starting character start with high legitimacy and so they have more power and they have the power to vassalize people even if those people are not de jure apart of their duchy or kingdom.

It happened to me and I am still mad about it.
Plagues are interesting, and definitely add a much needed threat for the player - but it still feels like it could have been better, and IMO outbreaks seem to be biased to happen in the player's territory, or at least in close proximity.
On top of that, full of bugs, and it's a shame that this is the expected standard by now from Paradox.

Also, minor detail, but, on release day, in the Developer Livestream there was a question from the community if Isolationist cultures get a bonus to plague resistance, which was affirmed by a Dev, but in the game, if this is true, there is no indicator for it in the cultural tradition. I doubt they actually implemented it. Could be a honest mistake, or could be an indicator for greater issues at Paradox.

I have tried to be as optimistic and fair as possible but I just cannot understand the praise this DLC gets from the community. Compare it to Bloodlines in CK2 and it's just a pure joke.

This DLC is not substandard, it is not terribly unbalanced or anything like that. It is simply... meh. Legends fade way too quickly, you would think the exalted among men emperor of the newly restored Roman Empire, who claims to be the son of a lynx and visited by god would be something remembered forever in the annuals of history? Nope, in about two generations literally everybody has forgotten about him- Not even a mention of his name. The legends are generic too which really doesn't help the situation. The best example of this is Ottar ""Die Vogel"" of house Babenberger, a legendary ruler who restored the Holy Roman Empire from a mere county in Wien, destroying his enemies and launching grand holy wars into England, overrun by heathens. 

This sounds awesome right? Something mentioned in his legend ""Battle of Cumberland"" the battle which decided the fate of Scotland, England and Ireland? Nope, the legend mentions how he visited Canterbury and some generic event where he is 'visited by god' which is actually just a 100 year old randomly generated lowborn character, it doesn't even get the details of the battle itself correct, Ottar had no reinforcements or aid from anybody, his snake-like Karling allies refusing to aid him in his noble quest for Christendom... yet it says here how the battle was nearly lost (which is correct until a battle roll went in his favour) until his horsemen (the only men at arms unit I hadn't invested in) smashed through the enemy Varangian heavy infantry... a unit that counters heavy horsemen.

The legends in short are painfully generic, nothing unique about them exists. All the origin legends detail about how you were born from a pool of Ragnarr Lothbrok or Arthur Pendragon's own 'flesh and blood'. Cool, until you see it again, and again, and again and then some more halfway across the world. These origin legends are pretty much exclusive to Europe too, nothing in Persia claiming to be from the ages of Darius, nothing in Greece about Alexander the GREAT, nothing about Genghis Khan after he falls, imagine how cool that would be? Nope.

To conclude, all the legends feel like they were written by chat GPT, nothing unique or interesting about them, to add insult to injury, Ottar's statue didn't even have his name on it, just generic flavour text about a ruler immortalized in stone. His legend faded and in 2 generations, the legendary ruler of the HRE, destroyer of heathens, incredible commander and wily as a hawk had faded into complete obscurity, the only reminder of his existence being a small statue in Cumberland with a popular opinion boost.

It really feels like a much, much worse version of bloodlines to me.

Legitimacy feels very poorly balanced and overall just punitive and removing of more player agency over their realm. Perhaps there can be a proper balancing of it but it really feels far more stick than carrot. The legitimacy hits from disinheriting for example are needlessly expensive, especially when it's having secondary children take the vows...

Disease meanwhile feels marginally less fleshed out than in CK2 reapers due, ESPECIALLY in terms of Hospitals and Plague vulnerability/resistance, the barony buildings really feel less enjoyable to engage with than Hospitals in CK2.

legends are the most half baked feature to come out of ck3 yet. even court artefact spamming has some level of interaction with it, but legends are truly awful. its start legend, wait for a bit, mindlessly click through event spam about it (I have seen the same event 4 separate times in the same playthrough for multiple events), click button to upgrade, repeat this step again, then click complete, get some generic bonuses or some region specific claims, and now you can never use this legend again for the rest of the game. 

that's right, in a game about dynastic succession, about seeing how each character's actions build onto each other, only one character in your entire dynasty can use a legend seed. according to this dlc, if Louis the stammerer claimed to be the decedent of Charlemagne, none of his line afterwards could EVER claim the same again. the biggest middle finger to the player? after all is said and done, and you complete your so called 'legend', not only does it die off the map completely in just a few decades, but you cant even read the chronicle. that's right, the devs who claim this is a role-playing game as an excuse for giving us barely any mechanics besides event spam for 3 years, have the main role-play feature of their new dlc straight up disappear from player view almost instantly.
 
the common sense way to do this is have legends actually affect your dynasty long term, and give them a set of standards to adhere too to appear more like their claimed ancestor. If you want people to see you as the heir of Charlemagne, defeat the Saracens in battle, have a group of famed knights who you ride into battle with, be crowned by the pope, defeat rebellious vassals, etc. if you fail at these things, people will see you as not living up to your claimed ancestry, giving worse penalties then failing these things normally. the worst part is that most of these issues cant be fixed by modding. I have looked into (and posted) a mod that tries to fix legends, but with how fundamentally flawed the system at its core, a mod can only put a bandied on the bullet wound.

plagues are pretty solid, if deadly (as they should be to an extent), but could have used a bit more depth which they could have gotten if resources were not wasted on the abysmal legends system. pretty self explanatory tbh, if you have played ck2, they are not too different

as for bugs, I have noticed some with the new sound effects (which im not a fan of compared to the old), and some bigger ones, like a random unlanded character occupying land for some inexplicable reason.

overall legends are awful, being yet another event spam coated with an unintuitive ui over it, and the additions the dlc gives to plagues are not worth it, as most of the new plague mechanics are base game. skip if you didn't buy chapter 3, and if you were like me and got blinded by byzantine empire and landless hype and instantly clicked buy on chapter 3, lets pray that they make up for this. ck3 cant (or rather shouldn't) survive another year of disappointments like the last few."

76561199015144202,2671060,False,0.956526696681976318,"Sadly, most of the content is badly designed RNG.

Personally i deem procedurally generated content to be a great way of increasing the variation and the longevity of content within a game.

However; if not enough care is taken to properly, and logically, integrate such content within a game this content can be very distracting, bad, and non-immersive.

The inclusion of legends could be grand for the game. To experience how your deeds not only influence the world, but also the tales told about your dynasty within it would be amazingly immersive. To see how bards, and sometimes you, twist truth into a more exciting form could be fun.

But sadly, legends fall under the category of badly procedurally generated content.

Take the following example:

My ruler was King Dumnarth of Cornwall. One of my favorite starts in 867, btw. It¬¥s fun to enter the fight for britain as a brythonic ruler.

King Dumnarth conquered the neighboring duchies of Wessex and Hwicce rather easily. And then, in a bid to increase his legitimacy and gather some prestige, he started spreading the legend that he and his line are descended from King Arthur.

While doing so Britanny was conquered by a norse Adventurer. King Dumnarth set sail in order to conquer free his bretic brethren from the Heathens. He won some great victories and drove them off, adding Britanny to his Demesne.

Then he proclaimed the Kingdom of Dumnonia. (Via the found a new kingdom decision, not the restore the kingdom of cornwall one.)

In gameplay terms this wasn¬¥t that much. In in-universe terms, though, this was something rather significant. A major victory against the Norse invaders was won and a new bretic kingdom, spanning the channel, formed.

This is the stuff of legends! What better to support his claim of descent from King Arthur, than to prove such undertakings!

However, it isn¬¥t reflected in the legend. At all.

The Legend fails in two ways, both the result of badly procedurally generated content. Content which is completely random, without being integrated in a sensible manner.

1.) It doesn¬¥t tie into the King Arthur myth at all. Arthur is mentioned once, but aside from this- nothing. It doesn¬¥t tie into this claim logically. A basic way this could, and has been done, would be to claim descent from him. Or to claim to have performed similiar feats. (Being visited by Merlin, finding excalibur, something.)

Instead the non-sensical claim of being birthed from a pool of blood and flesh is given. Yeah. Even though many people still alive in his kingdom will have known his parents. The same claim can be found in many other generated legends.

2.) It doesn¬¥t properly take into account which deeds of his have been noteworthy. I don¬¥t know how the selection works- If simply some deeds are eligible and some not, or if purely some random ones are chosen- But in this legend it didn¬¥t deign to mention his conquest of brittany and the victory over heathen invaders, nor does it mention the founding of a new kingdom.

Instead it chose to mention that one time he rode to some church, two baronies away from the border of his kingdom.

This isn¬¥t a fictionalised story of my character. This is [PICK RANDOM TEXT 1] + [PICK RANDOM TEXT 2] + [PICK RANDOM MEMORY FROM ROOT_CHARACTER].

Plagues and new disease mechanics: Mostly part of the free patch and  as far as I can tell basically lifted 1:1 from CK2 and the parts that are part of the DLC are sold back to players at an insane price, despite the assertions from Paradox that they were going to take time to put thought into new systems and mechanics to expand the game past what existed in CK2 - at least characters actually die now though this entire change now continues the trend of adding more and more costs to the game with no way to supplement income the game is still functioning on the basic economy system from CK2 a game that is almost 15 years old

Legitimacy: A shoehorned system that just adds further hoops to jump through to keep vassals in line seems mostly designed to encourage people to use the horrible and repetitive hold court feature from Royal Court the other horrible content release for CK3 - just another random stat you have to manage to keep people from rebelling ever few years and even when you do manage it the system only serves to force you to play in one way

Funerals: 3 years into a game all about playing individual rulers, managing a family and eventually dying to only now be getting funerals (who knows when coronations, accessions or investiture ceremonies will be added but I won't hold my breath)

[u]Bloodlines in CK2[/u]
Bloodlines were not only more dynamic but also more fun to collect. One of my favourite things to do in Ck2 was to consolidate bloodlines through intricate breeding projects. It needed planning, patience, determination and knowledge of different game mechanics. If you did not start with a bloodline you also had the option to set an ambition to create one. These created bloodlines could vary [b]wildly[/b], from peaceful ruler to bloodthirsty murderer and gave permanent modifiers that corresponded with the type of bloodline. There were in total [b]THIRTY+[/b] unique bloodlines the player could create. These were great for RP and gameplay. You could look back at your ancestor and go, ""Damn that guy that got the warrior lodge bloodline was a badass"" while also getting the prowess from being related to him. 

[u]Legends in CK3[/u]
Legends of the dead gives you [b]FOUR[/b] types of legends. Heroic, saint, legitimacy and an unofficial ancestor one. 
Heroic gives you claims, saint converts your realm and legitimacy gives you legitimacy and ancestor let's you revive a dead culture. That's the long and the short of it. You get extra things like a special building slot and an artefact which are ok. The legend is not permanent and costs 1/4 of your income over five years to produce. During these five years you have little to no impact of what the ""legend"" will actually say. 

Most of the time the legend will be filled with what feels like ChatGPT gibberish of plagues, bandits and local lords. As such the legend description with the exception of some will feel the same. Conquering Byzantium, mending the Schism, dismantling the Papacy and restoring Rome legends were nearly indistinguishable from each other in my run. People also seem to have the memory of goldfish, legends like King Arthur which have been passed down from 12th century to today are seemingly forgotten within decades. Legends like King Arthur are also known worldwide and feature in the pop culture of nations thousands of kilometres from Wales. In CK3 you'll be lucky if the peasants in Rome even know who restored the empire because the legend can only expand to 501 baronies.

[u]Plagues[/u]
The three extra ones and the black death are also part of this DLC I guess. They're fine but with all the difficulty settings set to max they're at most a nuisance.

Legends are character-specific (No Legends that define your dynasty like CK2 Bloodlines) and while they can be inherited, they are not inherited by your heir, rather your legend goes to a arbitrarily-assigned dynasty member and frankly, I have no clue how the game decides who gets it. That's assuming you die soon enough for it to be inherited, since most legends deactivate after a few decades. Apparently single-handily stopping a viking invasion stops mattering after 20 years, and nobody cares if your father unified England and claimed descent from King Arthur.

Legitimacy is a complete joke. It's character-specific, not title specific, so the game does not care about the scenario the devs themselves pointed out (Whether or not a French warrior-prince should be considered the rightful ruler of Byzantium), as long as you were legitimate in whatever title you had before, you're legitimate in all of them. 

Also a sudden UI revamp that, while not that bad honestly, came out of nowhere and they replaced all the click sounds with a very annoying ""Sword unsheathe, sword sheath"" sound that grates on you very quickly. Again, nothing like this was mentioned in the dev diaries and there is currently no way to change it.

There is also none of the flavor additions that CK2's Reaper's Due DLC gave, such as multiple execution methods.

Paradox keeps on missing. They had a solid base in CK2 and instead of refining it or adapting it for CK3, they decided to get ''creative''. What they came up with falls short of anything they promised in the trailers and dev blogs.

- Legends disappear after 20-something years after being made. They don't require any specific actions unlike they did in CK2, essentially you pay once, and then wait for the map to be painted with ''your legend is spreading''
- More than half of the events that are supposed to increase legitimacy don't work, I've tried different events: tours, feasts, weddings, funerals, so on. Only feasts had an actual even that actually increased legitimacy.
- Legitimacy system in itself is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, you can have the same family ruling the kingdom/empire since the start of the game and some rulers will randomly start with legitimacy at max and others have it at maybe 1st or 2nd out of 5 levels.
- Plagues are nothing more than a nuisance and money sink for rebuilding efforts, and that's it. You'll see constant pop-ups ''Isolate yourself/capital'' each time any plague shows up on the  map. (A simple fix to that would be to make this option become an event ONLY when the plague reaches your personal domain - Paradox, take notes)"

I've played significantly more now and wow this DLC's new mechanics are a hot mess. I'll review it with the new free update.

1) Legitimacy. It's interesting, but not a single character starts with any levels of legitimacy, so the early game for everyone is just going to be a slog with needing to gain legitimacy

2) Diseases. oh diseases. This has been been something we have asked PDS to give us for several years now. It was a machochist's love from CK2, and now it's here, except now it's really annoying. diseases come every couple of years in random spots in the world, meaning if you're nearby any or you have a large empire, you're going to get event spammed with the same 3 events over and over and over again. the result from the events are never beneficial. they just happen. 

3) Legends. the big selling point and the thing actually on sale with this DLC is just ok. they're neat, but they are not spell/grammar checked at all, and are abusable. The AI will pursue legends, because why wouldn't you, and will often try to pay you to help spread the legend. but you spreading the legend costs gold per month to upkeep, so it really isn't worth your time much. so you can take their gold, and immediately stop promoting the legend. now if balance was a thing that existed, you might take a prestige hit, after all you just broke a deal? nope. maybe you lose some legitimacy, that cool new feature with this update? still no. ok, how about just an opinion hit? nope. It's free money, it's just free money. and that same character will try to pay you again a few months later, so we do the same thing again.
Legends spread from county to county based on who is spreading the legend and from a radius around where it originated, but there is a max to how far a legend can spread. The way it spreads is almost like a disease would spread, and that is probably why we got diseases in this update as well. Overall Legends are super underdeveloped and don't really add much to your gameplay

4) Funerals. Ah funerals the new activity you can do to gain legitimacy, lower stress, gain prestige, boost opinions, ... seduce someone, murder someone else. It's honestly a great activity. There's even an event during it where characters will reminisce on memories they have from the memories journal. except that characters don't generate memories of other characters at all, so the only thing they reminisce about them is when they declared war on them, slept with them, they died, or they killed them. most of the time they aren't even known as the killer. they just out themselves with a ""i killed him yeah""

The Legends: A cool concept that give good rewards but are effectively a money sink. Range from a simple boost to development and skill boosts to ""you now have a claim to every independent title in Iberia"". The events around legends can be enjoyable but once you promote one legend to mythical status, you have seen all the events (and even your first time there can be repetition). My biggest complaint is that legends only last 20 years once completed, even though, especially if your pushing mythical, it can be a multi-generational effort, and unless you go all the way some of the rewards are RNG.

Legitimacy: ok this is free update content but I need to rant somewhere, legitimacy is annoying. You lose way to much to plagues and losing a single battle but winning wars SOMETIMES give as much as back as losing a battle, but WINNING a battle outnumbered 3:1 does...nothing. Unless you do a legitimizing legend you can spend 50 years building up to level four, only for about 3-4 bad events in about the same amount of years knocks you to tier 3. And as for what tier is considered ""acceptable"" for your rank? Dont know, it bounced between 3-4 when I was a king, and always seemed to be where I was at least one level behind. Most of the advantages of high legitimacy are moot since unlike royal court each tier doesnt give benefits, only negates a penalty, while being over legitimacy is nigh impossible for kings who can actually make use of the bonuses like ""increased vassal acceptance chance"" but good luck maxing out the bar and keeping it for more then a year."

If you are an usurper or startup ruler, you will have a slight struggle especially if your vassals are of different culture than you and your cultural acceptance is low. This mechanic adds a slight complexity on how vassals will accept your rule but overall not that impactful.

Plagues are another new mechanic added to the game which is basically also not that impactful since plague strength isn't that optimized even at full strength. You'll see ""casualties"" pertaining to the plague in question but it'll usually fizzle out before even killing 100 people, which is kinda underwhelming. I had to tell my court physician not to help with the plague so that I could actually experience the mechanic on my city. There are also no random events tied to plagues like not washing your hands after a hunt or falling into a latrine, causing a plague on your household if you have low learning, etc. Overall, plagues appear to be quite bland and just spams you with notifications of plagues that are just minor annoyances.

76561198075931333,2671060,False,0.655312597751617432,"Legends of the Dead proudly continues the tradition of pointless ""DLC for the sake of DLC"" for CK3, failing to polish or improve core gameplay but instead throwing in an array of features that are either stepping on the toes of existing mechanics, not making the experience better, or even making it worse. Let's get into fine details, shall we?

[h2]Plagues[/h2]

So, for the uninitiated, CK3 is a character-driven and focused RPG-meets-Sims game. Back when the game released 3 years ago, the design intent was to really invest into your characters, make them live long, have great education and congenital traits. The game really encouraged that with mechanics like Long/Short Reign, legacies like Octogenarians and Graceful Aging etc. However, a part of the community complained the game is not ""hardcore"" enough. As a result we got so called ""harm events"" in one of the updates, with the idea of randomly forcing death/crippling events on your characters and going completely against everything established previously. 

Plagues is the continuation of the trend. It adds the separate ""elderly heath"" stat to further cripple your characters beyond certain age, and otherwise all it does is randomly forces diseases on them. If previously my Rurik would live into his 60th - with this DLC he died in the early 50th from smallpox, and his son Helgi inherited at 27 and instantly got cancer. RIP. In the game where unplanned character death is akin to having your saves wiped it goes without saying how terrible these additions are. And the plagues are so constant that I eventually learned to live with them and ignore the constant buttons for ""Go into seclusion"" and ""Isolate the capital"" popping on my screen.

[h2]Legitimacy[/h2]

This mechanics is simple ""win more"" power creep that if you're a good player makes the game even easier and if you struggle makes it even worse for you. Win a few wars and do a feast and you notice it's easier to vassalize or make alliances. Lose a battle though, and you are hit with internal instability on top of that. Marry a beautiful lowborn girl and you're now hit with legitimacy penalty on top of the prestige one. The rising legitimacy expectations based on your rank are there to make it more difficult to keep kingdoms and empires together. However, this mechanics is superficial and in reality does little to change how the game is played. Like if you have the biggest army and the wealthiest domain around - you can pretty much forget legitimacy exists. 

[h2]Legends[/h2]

And this is a money sink. In the early game, maintaining and spreading a legend will cost you the money you could have spent on a large army, making it not really viable. And in the late game the rewards of the mechanics are pretty irrelevant. Imagine spending 3 legacy points to get a perk that grants your character a Saint trait, but you need to work for 100-200 years to complete a Mythic holy legend for it. The most important reward for legend completion are ""Legendary buildings"" - however those compete with existing Special buildings and Holy Sites for slots and end up being less powerful versions of those. This makes legends pointless if your domain is something like Paris or Rome, and while it could be useful if you want to make your domain in the middle of nowhere somewhat viable - you wouldn't have the funds to get it done in the first place. And the last reward is a book containing the legend (with random text which feels like written by ChatGPT) which only the character who completed the legend can commission for an additional sum of gold.

So there you have it - one mechanics that is harmful to the experience, one mechanics that is plain unnecessary, and one more that could be good if it wasn't half-baked and designed to be more than a money sink."

76561198114803179,2671060,True,0.648114025592803955,"Well. For me it is a decent addition. The additions of the Patch itself outweighs the addtitions of the DLC itself.

The pros are:

1) Plagues and Diseases are back. And they are a bit of fun.
2) It has some fun additions for Roleplaying purposes despite being more of a systemic pack.
3) The UI has gotten a lot better too. Espescially for some of the older mechanics as court positions.
4) While you could cheese Legitimacy and Legends it is more fun to let them run in a more role playing like style.

The cons are:

1) Legends could need more depth and there should be some more unique legends for many regions (Persia could need at least three more. Tibet also and why are things like the G√∂kturks not really a seed. I don't want to start with Africa).
2) Also there should be some ancestrial legends of your Dynasty in the late game.
3) The AI seems to have issues with legitimacy? I have the feel that they sometimes let it fall apart even with being able to avoid this situation.

For me it is a 7/10. It is not as good as Fate of Iberia or Tours and Tournaments and is a fine addition. Either get it in the Chaptr 3 Bundle or in a Sale as it is not amazing T&T or an all around good pack as Fate of Iberia.

The content isn't very deep but considering the changes are largely geared towards the whole map and not a specific region. I can cut the devs a little slack. Otherwise legends(the paid portion) adds another layer to game play which is nice. However, for current players after a couple hours the gameplay isn't fun/unique enough to maintain engagement. I recommend buying it on sale or getting the bundle because Roads to Power seems like it will actually be great. 

Lastly, I swear the people who extol the virtues of CK2 bought it in the final year of development.

I feel like they were trying to introduce plagues without the ""haha you randomly died"" since they got such a bad reception with that during their last expansions, however plagues is probably the only place it's actually warranted lol

Onto Legends and Legitimacy. Legends have almost no lasting effects on your family, some of them are really cool, some of the vikings get a ""legendary adventure"" which allows you to basically leave your kingdom and go somewhere else again which wraps up nicely with their wrath of the norsemen side. I was loving it, until I died and i realised that it barely mattered and just slowly lagged out leaving no mark on my dynasty. 

Legitimacy is cool, I've had no bugs or anything that others are reporting but I absolutely hate that nobody seems to be playing by the same legitimacy rules as me, no flavour around chipping away at peoples legitimacy, sabotaging them etc etc especially interfamily

Granted, a fair share of the core returning plague mechanics are part of the free ""scythe"" update, only some extra elements and more expanded bits are part of the DLC pack related to the plague mechanics such as funerals, additional varieties in plagues, more fleshed out Black Death. 

However the 2nd focus those being legends which sounded like about the same what we had with bloodlines in CK2's final update fall kinda flat due one major issue, there is no way extend a legend , legends you create for your character and dynasti fade away in mere years which makes no sense, this is an issue that honestly can very easily be fixed by simply increasing somewhat how long a legend can exist and adding some simple additional mechanic in which future generation can keep the family legends going and have them always be inherited. 

Due to to the issue of the bizarrely short legends, a lot of people who unlike me maybe weren't mainly excited for the plagues but instead for the legends mechanic were let down thus , this has dropped to mixed reviews but since i am someone who primarily was excited and focused on the plagues returning, the legends stuff was more of an extra side thing for me so it didn't bum me out when it turned out it has this weird design flaw that i do hope will be fixed.

So due to this, i am still really happy, i was so excited to see dynamic plagues and diseases come back , though i would suggest waiting for a bit of a discount on this DLC, it's more worth it for like 15 bucks, maybe a tad less, i did get mine from a 3rd party store where they had a slight discount dropping it to 15 which felt more fair then these bizzare new awful prices they hiked up for CK3 DLC a year or so ago.

Reading a lot of the negative reviews, it seems like people want to be negative for the sake of being negative.

Are there some rough edges for Legends of the Dead?  Yes.  Did Paradox have to do a patch after going live to fix an issue?  Yes.  Did Legends of the dead (The DLC not just the free expansion) change the game?  Yes it did.   Was Legends of the Dead as good as Bloodlines from Crusader Kings II?  I don‚Äôt know, that‚Äôs a very subjective question, but is Legends of the Dead worth $19.99?  Absolutely.  Without a doubt.  Absolutely."

I think the plague mechanics are fine, though the base system was added to the main game for free, so really you're just paying for a few extra potential negative modifiers, names of plagues, and one RNG event chain. Legitimacy is pretty interesting as well and makes the game more challenging by giving you more penalties for trying to marry Genius peasants into your bloodline. But, once again legitimacy was added to the base game for free so it's not something you're paying for. They're starting to add ""Sub-tasks"" that your court positions like the Physician can do, which is great and gives the player more control over their court, but once again that's free with the base game.

So, if most of the major features of the DLC are actually free with the base game, what do you get here? A couple of RNG event chains, a handful of new clothes, the ability to hold funerals, and Legends. Legends feels like something thrown together at the last second to justify this being a major update and ""Major"" DLC instead of a major update and minor DLC. Through the mechanic of ""Legends"" players are now supposed to be able to create lasting legends for their dynasty that make you out to be a hero, legitimize your dynasty's right to rule, or turn you into a saint among men. That all sounds great on paper, but in reality Legends are little more than an RNG gold sink. You have no real power over what your legend is about, what deeds it promotes, or what the final story will be, in fact the final legend feels like chatGPT was fed every memory of my character and then forced to spit out the most mundane drivel it could think of. 
""Here's the legend of how kind Midas walked two counties over to visit a church."" Meanwhile in my lifetime I united an entire kingdom and drove out a massive plague. The rewards for creating a Legend include an ok artifact, and a ""Legendary"" building. These legendary buildings compete for existing duchy buildings and are generally simply on par with what you can already build though they do have some nice models for the buildings. 
To top it off legends are not a permanent thing despite all the effort that goes into building them. Depending on how much money and effort you sunk into a legend it will stick around for between 20 and 100 years. That's right, you can create a ""Legend"" and still be alive when everyone has forgotten all about it. King Arthur who? Saint Edward, never heard of him. Now, I could see legends needing upkeep if the rewards were truly powerful, and the need to erase or supersede a legend to create a new one, but the fact that they're called LEGENDS and are forgotten in less than a generation is terrible design and it makes it feel pretty bad creating them.
CK2 already did legends better, they were called bloodlines. The devs need to take a look back at what they already did and improve upon it instead of creating worse, less interesting features.

Seeing my king create a legend at just 30 years old, only to see it totally disappear WHILE HE IS STILL ALIVE AND MAKING NEW CONQUESTS, sounds very stupid, doesn't it? I think the developers were more concerned with balancing the new mechanic than actually making it interesting and fun to play. I hope that the community's comments will be listened to and that this problem will be solved, if not by Paradox then at least by the community itself (thanks to all the modders out there btw, you truly are the best that mankind can offer) which would save us again from a mechanic created and promptly abandoned.

Oh true, I was forgetting to talk about legitimacy, but only because I had actually forgotten that it existed. Yet another mechanic with so much potential, but too timid to be taken seriously.

So the plague system is basically Reapers DLC from CK2; diseases and plagues are more deadly and have more consequences, which is excellent.

Unfortunately, the Legends system is poorly implemented; legends are costly to maintain yet do not last very long; aside from the most important legitimacy gain, there really isn't any reason to interact with the Legends system. 
As mentioned, Legends lasts a very short while after it's completed, and without dynastic interaction or any interaction with conquered land, the legends mechanic feels really hollow and shallow a system.

Legitimacy itself is also not anything interesting. Firstly, legitimacy gives buffs and debuffs, but does not affect the way claims are pushed if anything it feels more like short reign and long reign debuff and buff, respectively and feels redundant with the way it is implemented. 

Secondly the easiest way to gain legitimacy is through warfare, as other activities such as feasts, tours and weddinngs etc. are very costly. This now discourages play styles do not involve warfare, for example diplomacy and intrigue play styles will generate little to no legitimacy which almost guarantees that you will have to play the game with a major debuff.

I‚Äôve had rulers that had their capital plagued 5 times before they even turned 40 years old, and i‚Äôve seen ireland turn into a desert with 0 development on the late start-date because they were hit near constantly by plagues with nothing to defend themselves.

Legitimacy has been the most awful thing i‚Äôve seen so far, where none of the already existing events and dialogues affect it at all, but the newly added funeral gives you absolute tons of it.
Why even hold feasts when you can marry an old lady and go to her funeral as soon as she dies. The whole system makes no sense anymore. And the fact that you getting his by plagues every week drops your legitimacy too fast for you to do anything anyways.

The legends are really quite stale. On top of that it's weird that you build up the legend yourself, as if a legend is some sort of ""top down"" thing in our world, rather than a story that gets passed around a community until it becomes something more than whatever event touched it off. I understand this is a video game, and that it is a representation of the world rather than a mirror of it, but this is so awkward and false in its execution, in its logic, that I cannot look past it. 

Legitimacy, a new mechanic meant to reflect how your community/realm views you, seems like a great idea at the start. Except there really was a mechanic for it already, in your relationship to individual characters. Legitimacy is, by a modern definition, the personal belief in the authority of a figure or an institution. Now instead of your character having a personal relationship with every other character, and that reflecting their individual loyalties to you as a ruler, their opinion is collated into a monolithic bar that you must seek to fill with video game points. 

Again, it is a reflection of a reality, rather than a mirror, but there was already a much better reflection in the game. One that was far more subtle. 

In truth this betrays an even greater problem with the game. What is the difference between authority and power? Power is the ability to make someone do something through threat of violence. Authority is the ability to command someone righteously. The Catholic Church, as portrayed in the game, is barely an entity. In reality, in the Middle Ages, it was the authoritative institution of the West. 

To have any legitimacy in a ruler, in a representation of the Christian West, the Church must be the authority to dispense that legitimacy. 

Feasts and hunts and fine robes do not a King make. Not in this place and this time period (or ever really). The authority of such things has to be lodged in something more than the material world. It has to come from a metaphysical ideal. In that regard, CK3 is like a scientific treatise. It proffers a neutral, sterilized view of the world in which the only recognized legitimacy at all is the ability and willingness to use violence to get what you want.

It happened to me and I am still mad about it.
Plagues are interesting, and definitely add a much needed threat for the player - but it still feels like it could have been better, and IMO outbreaks seem to be biased to happen in the player's territory, or at least in close proximity.
On top of that, full of bugs, and it's a shame that this is the expected standard by now from Paradox.

Also, minor detail, but, on release day, in the Developer Livestream there was a question from the community if Isolationist cultures get a bonus to plague resistance, which was affirmed by a Dev, but in the game, if this is true, there is no indicator for it in the cultural tradition. I doubt they actually implemented it. Could be a honest mistake, or could be an indicator for greater issues at Paradox.

I have tried to be as optimistic and fair as possible but I just cannot understand the praise this DLC gets from the community. Compare it to Bloodlines in CK2 and it's just a pure joke.

This DLC is not substandard, it is not terribly unbalanced or anything like that. It is simply... meh. Legends fade way too quickly, you would think the exalted among men emperor of the newly restored Roman Empire, who claims to be the son of a lynx and visited by god would be something remembered forever in the annuals of history? Nope, in about two generations literally everybody has forgotten about him- Not even a mention of his name. The legends are generic too which really doesn't help the situation. The best example of this is Ottar ""Die Vogel"" of house Babenberger, a legendary ruler who restored the Holy Roman Empire from a mere county in Wien, destroying his enemies and launching grand holy wars into England, overrun by heathens. 

This sounds awesome right? Something mentioned in his legend ""Battle of Cumberland"" the battle which decided the fate of Scotland, England and Ireland? Nope, the legend mentions how he visited Canterbury and some generic event where he is 'visited by god' which is actually just a 100 year old randomly generated lowborn character, it doesn't even get the details of the battle itself correct, Ottar had no reinforcements or aid from anybody, his snake-like Karling allies refusing to aid him in his noble quest for Christendom... yet it says here how the battle was nearly lost (which is correct until a battle roll went in his favour) until his horsemen (the only men at arms unit I hadn't invested in) smashed through the enemy Varangian heavy infantry... a unit that counters heavy horsemen.

The legends in short are painfully generic, nothing unique about them exists. All the origin legends detail about how you were born from a pool of Ragnarr Lothbrok or Arthur Pendragon's own 'flesh and blood'. Cool, until you see it again, and again, and again and then some more halfway across the world. These origin legends are pretty much exclusive to Europe too, nothing in Persia claiming to be from the ages of Darius, nothing in Greece about Alexander the GREAT, nothing about Genghis Khan after he falls, imagine how cool that would be? Nope.

To conclude, all the legends feel like they were written by chat GPT, nothing unique or interesting about them, to add insult to injury, Ottar's statue didn't even have his name on it, just generic flavour text about a ruler immortalized in stone. His legend faded and in 2 generations, the legendary ruler of the HRE, destroyer of heathens, incredible commander and wily as a hawk had faded into complete obscurity, the only reminder of his existence being a small statue in Cumberland with a popular opinion boost.

It really feels like a much, much worse version of bloodlines to me.

Legitimacy feels very poorly balanced and overall just punitive and removing of more player agency over their realm. Perhaps there can be a proper balancing of it but it really feels far more stick than carrot. The legitimacy hits from disinheriting for example are needlessly expensive, especially when it's having secondary children take the vows...

Disease meanwhile feels marginally less fleshed out than in CK2 reapers due, ESPECIALLY in terms of Hospitals and Plague vulnerability/resistance, the barony buildings really feel less enjoyable to engage with than Hospitals in CK2.

legends are the most half baked feature to come out of ck3 yet. even court artefact spamming has some level of interaction with it, but legends are truly awful. its start legend, wait for a bit, mindlessly click through event spam about it (I have seen the same event 4 separate times in the same playthrough for multiple events), click button to upgrade, repeat this step again, then click complete, get some generic bonuses or some region specific claims, and now you can never use this legend again for the rest of the game. 

that's right, in a game about dynastic succession, about seeing how each character's actions build onto each other, only one character in your entire dynasty can use a legend seed. according to this dlc, if Louis the stammerer claimed to be the decedent of Charlemagne, none of his line afterwards could EVER claim the same again. the biggest middle finger to the player? after all is said and done, and you complete your so called 'legend', not only does it die off the map completely in just a few decades, but you cant even read the chronicle. that's right, the devs who claim this is a role-playing game as an excuse for giving us barely any mechanics besides event spam for 3 years, have the main role-play feature of their new dlc straight up disappear from player view almost instantly.
 
the common sense way to do this is have legends actually affect your dynasty long term, and give them a set of standards to adhere too to appear more like their claimed ancestor. If you want people to see you as the heir of Charlemagne, defeat the Saracens in battle, have a group of famed knights who you ride into battle with, be crowned by the pope, defeat rebellious vassals, etc. if you fail at these things, people will see you as not living up to your claimed ancestry, giving worse penalties then failing these things normally. the worst part is that most of these issues cant be fixed by modding. I have looked into (and posted) a mod that tries to fix legends, but with how fundamentally flawed the system at its core, a mod can only put a bandied on the bullet wound.

plagues are pretty solid, if deadly (as they should be to an extent), but could have used a bit more depth which they could have gotten if resources were not wasted on the abysmal legends system. pretty self explanatory tbh, if you have played ck2, they are not too different

as for bugs, I have noticed some with the new sound effects (which im not a fan of compared to the old), and some bigger ones, like a random unlanded character occupying land for some inexplicable reason.

overall legends are awful, being yet another event spam coated with an unintuitive ui over it, and the additions the dlc gives to plagues are not worth it, as most of the new plague mechanics are base game. skip if you didn't buy chapter 3, and if you were like me and got blinded by byzantine empire and landless hype and instantly clicked buy on chapter 3, lets pray that they make up for this. ck3 cant (or rather shouldn't) survive another year of disappointments like the last few."

Personally i deem procedurally generated content to be a great way of increasing the variation and the longevity of content within a game.

However; if not enough care is taken to properly, and logically, integrate such content within a game this content can be very distracting, bad, and non-immersive.

The inclusion of legends could be grand for the game. To experience how your deeds not only influence the world, but also the tales told about your dynasty within it would be amazingly immersive. To see how bards, and sometimes you, twist truth into a more exciting form could be fun.

But sadly, legends fall under the category of badly procedurally generated content.

Take the following example:

My ruler was King Dumnarth of Cornwall. One of my favorite starts in 867, btw. It¬¥s fun to enter the fight for britain as a brythonic ruler.

King Dumnarth conquered the neighboring duchies of Wessex and Hwicce rather easily. And then, in a bid to increase his legitimacy and gather some prestige, he started spreading the legend that he and his line are descended from King Arthur.

While doing so Britanny was conquered by a norse Adventurer. King Dumnarth set sail in order to conquer free his bretic brethren from the Heathens. He won some great victories and drove them off, adding Britanny to his Demesne.

Then he proclaimed the Kingdom of Dumnonia. (Via the found a new kingdom decision, not the restore the kingdom of cornwall one.)

In gameplay terms this wasn¬¥t that much. In in-universe terms, though, this was something rather significant. A major victory against the Norse invaders was won and a new bretic kingdom, spanning the channel, formed.

This is the stuff of legends! What better to support his claim of descent from King Arthur, than to prove such undertakings!

However, it isn¬¥t reflected in the legend. At all.

The Legend fails in two ways, both the result of badly procedurally generated content. Content which is completely random, without being integrated in a sensible manner.

1.) It doesn¬¥t tie into the King Arthur myth at all. Arthur is mentioned once, but aside from this- nothing. It doesn¬¥t tie into this claim logically. A basic way this could, and has been done, would be to claim descent from him. Or to claim to have performed similiar feats. (Being visited by Merlin, finding excalibur, something.)

Instead the non-sensical claim of being birthed from a pool of blood and flesh is given. Yeah. Even though many people still alive in his kingdom will have known his parents. The same claim can be found in many other generated legends.

2.) It doesn¬¥t properly take into account which deeds of his have been noteworthy. I don¬¥t know how the selection works- If simply some deeds are eligible and some not, or if purely some random ones are chosen- But in this legend it didn¬¥t deign to mention his conquest of brittany and the victory over heathen invaders, nor does it mention the founding of a new kingdom.

Instead it chose to mention that one time he rode to some church, two baronies away from the border of his kingdom.

This isn¬¥t a fictionalised story of my character. This is [PICK RANDOM TEXT 1] + [PICK RANDOM TEXT 2] + [PICK RANDOM MEMORY FROM ROOT_CHARACTER].

This, in my opinion, should definitely be changed."

Plagues and new disease mechanics: Mostly part of the free patch and  as far as I can tell basically lifted 1:1 from CK2 and the parts that are part of the DLC are sold back to players at an insane price, despite the assertions from Paradox that they were going to take time to put thought into new systems and mechanics to expand the game past what existed in CK2 - at least characters actually die now though this entire change now continues the trend of adding more and more costs to the game with no way to supplement income the game is still functioning on the basic economy system from CK2 a game that is almost 15 years old

Legitimacy: A shoehorned system that just adds further hoops to jump through to keep vassals in line seems mostly designed to encourage people to use the horrible and repetitive hold court feature from Royal Court the other horrible content release for CK3 - just another random stat you have to manage to keep people from rebelling ever few years and even when you do manage it the system only serves to force you to play in one way

[u]Bloodlines in CK2[/u]
Bloodlines were not only more dynamic but also more fun to collect. One of my favourite things to do in Ck2 was to consolidate bloodlines through intricate breeding projects. It needed planning, patience, determination and knowledge of different game mechanics. If you did not start with a bloodline you also had the option to set an ambition to create one. These created bloodlines could vary [b]wildly[/b], from peaceful ruler to bloodthirsty murderer and gave permanent modifiers that corresponded with the type of bloodline. There were in total [b]THIRTY+[/b] unique bloodlines the player could create. These were great for RP and gameplay. You could look back at your ancestor and go, ""Damn that guy that got the warrior lodge bloodline was a badass"" while also getting the prowess from being related to him. 

[u]Legends in CK3[/u]
Legends of the dead gives you [b]FOUR[/b] types of legends. Heroic, saint, legitimacy and an unofficial ancestor one. 
Heroic gives you claims, saint converts your realm and legitimacy gives you legitimacy and ancestor let's you revive a dead culture. That's the long and the short of it. You get extra things like a special building slot and an artefact which are ok. The legend is not permanent and costs 1/4 of your income over five years to produce. During these five years you have little to no impact of what the ""legend"" will actually say. 

Most of the time the legend will be filled with what feels like ChatGPT gibberish of plagues, bandits and local lords. As such the legend description with the exception of some will feel the same. Conquering Byzantium, mending the Schism, dismantling the Papacy and restoring Rome legends were nearly indistinguishable from each other in my run. People also seem to have the memory of goldfish, legends like King Arthur which have been passed down from 12th century to today are seemingly forgotten within decades. Legends like King Arthur are also known worldwide and feature in the pop culture of nations thousands of kilometres from Wales. In CK3 you'll be lucky if the peasants in Rome even know who restored the empire because the legend can only expand to 501 baronies.

[u]Plagues[/u]
The three extra ones and the black death are also part of this DLC I guess. They're fine but with all the difficulty settings set to max they're at most a nuisance.

Legends are character-specific (No Legends that define your dynasty like CK2 Bloodlines) and while they can be inherited, they are not inherited by your heir, rather your legend goes to a arbitrarily-assigned dynasty member and frankly, I have no clue how the game decides who gets it. That's assuming you die soon enough for it to be inherited, since most legends deactivate after a few decades. Apparently single-handily stopping a viking invasion stops mattering after 20 years, and nobody cares if your father unified England and claimed descent from King Arthur.

Legitimacy is a complete joke. It's character-specific, not title specific, so the game does not care about the scenario the devs themselves pointed out (Whether or not a French warrior-prince should be considered the rightful ruler of Byzantium), as long as you were legitimate in whatever title you had before, you're legitimate in all of them. 

Also a sudden UI revamp that, while not that bad honestly, came out of nowhere and they replaced all the click sounds with a very annoying ""Sword unsheathe, sword sheath"" sound that grates on you very quickly. Again, nothing like this was mentioned in the dev diaries and there is currently no way to change it.

There is also none of the flavor additions that CK2's Reaper's Due DLC gave, such as multiple execution methods.

Paradox keeps on missing. They had a solid base in CK2 and instead of refining it or adapting it for CK3, they decided to get ''creative''. What they came up with falls short of anything they promised in the trailers and dev blogs.

- Legends disappear after 20-something years after being made. They don't require any specific actions unlike they did in CK2, essentially you pay once, and then wait for the map to be painted with ''your legend is spreading''
- More than half of the events that are supposed to increase legitimacy don't work, I've tried different events: tours, feasts, weddings, funerals, so on. Only feasts had an actual even that actually increased legitimacy.
- Legitimacy system in itself is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, you can have the same family ruling the kingdom/empire since the start of the game and some rulers will randomly start with legitimacy at max and others have it at maybe 1st or 2nd out of 5 levels.
- Plagues are nothing more than a nuisance and money sink for rebuilding efforts, and that's it. You'll see constant pop-ups ''Isolate yourself/capital'' each time any plague shows up on the  map. (A simple fix to that would be to make this option become an event ONLY when the plague reaches your personal domain - Paradox, take notes)"

Yet another DLC that adds new features that have a lot of promise, but needed significantly more development time to make them good. It seems like their business model these days is to create a barebones framework that the modders can finish for them.

I've played significantly more now and wow this DLC's new mechanics are a hot mess. I'll review it with the new free update.

1) Legitimacy. It's interesting, but not a single character starts with any levels of legitimacy, so the early game for everyone is just going to be a slog with needing to gain legitimacy

2) Diseases. oh diseases. This has been been something we have asked PDS to give us for several years now. It was a machochist's love from CK2, and now it's here, except now it's really annoying. diseases come every couple of years in random spots in the world, meaning if you're nearby any or you have a large empire, you're going to get event spammed with the same 3 events over and over and over again. the result from the events are never beneficial. they just happen. 

3) Legends. the big selling point and the thing actually on sale with this DLC is just ok. they're neat, but they are not spell/grammar checked at all, and are abusable. The AI will pursue legends, because why wouldn't you, and will often try to pay you to help spread the legend. but you spreading the legend costs gold per month to upkeep, so it really isn't worth your time much. so you can take their gold, and immediately stop promoting the legend. now if balance was a thing that existed, you might take a prestige hit, after all you just broke a deal? nope. maybe you lose some legitimacy, that cool new feature with this update? still no. ok, how about just an opinion hit? nope. It's free money, it's just free money. and that same character will try to pay you again a few months later, so we do the same thing again.
Legends spread from county to county based on who is spreading the legend and from a radius around where it originated, but there is a max to how far a legend can spread. The way it spreads is almost like a disease would spread, and that is probably why we got diseases in this update as well. Overall Legends are super underdeveloped and don't really add much to your gameplay

4) Funerals. Ah funerals the new activity you can do to gain legitimacy, lower stress, gain prestige, boost opinions, ... seduce someone, murder someone else. It's honestly a great activity. There's even an event during it where characters will reminisce on memories they have from the memories journal. except that characters don't generate memories of other characters at all, so the only thing they reminisce about them is when they declared war on them, slept with them, they died, or they killed them. most of the time they aren't even known as the killer. they just out themselves with a ""i killed him yeah""

This DLC is a super underdeveloped product and I genuinely cannot recommend this for $20. maybe try again when its on sale with a steep discount. and wait until it gets more patches to fix the glaring issues, which will probably never come."

No legend is permenant in this DLC. Legends should be completely permenant like how we know about King Arthur Pendragon to this day and how some dynasties in history claimed to be coming from them.

The Legends: A cool concept that give good rewards but are effectively a money sink. Range from a simple boost to development and skill boosts to ""you now have a claim to every independent title in Iberia"". The events around legends can be enjoyable but once you promote one legend to mythical status, you have seen all the events (and even your first time there can be repetition). My biggest complaint is that legends only last 20 years once completed, even though, especially if your pushing mythical, it can be a multi-generational effort, and unless you go all the way some of the rewards are RNG.

The dead: Imma be 100% funerals should have been part of the free update. The plagues are ok, adding to the chaos of the game and a more dynamic if intangible threat, and diseases are now actually scary at times. Havnt actually played long enough to see the black death so cant comment on it but from what I have seen from the community it seems pretty interesting, though you lose a absolute ton of development. Overall 7/10, you get whats on the tin.

Legitimacy: ok this is free update content but I need to rant somewhere, legitimacy is annoying. You lose way to much to plagues and losing a single battle but winning wars SOMETIMES give as much as back as losing a battle, but WINNING a battle outnumbered 3:1 does...nothing. Unless you do a legitimizing legend you can spend 50 years building up to level four, only for about 3-4 bad events in about the same amount of years knocks you to tier 3. And as for what tier is considered ""acceptable"" for your rank? Dont know, it bounced between 3-4 when I was a king, and always seemed to be where I was at least one level behind. Most of the advantages of high legitimacy are moot since unlike royal court each tier doesnt give benefits, only negates a penalty, while being over legitimacy is nigh impossible for kings who can actually make use of the bonuses like ""increased vassal acceptance chance"" but good luck maxing out the bar and keeping it for more then a year."

Legitimacy is a new mechanic tied to the legends feature, but you don't need the DLC to have this mechanic. If you are an usurper or startup ruler, you will have a slight struggle especially if your vassals are of different culture than you and your cultural acceptance is low. This mechanic adds a slight complexity on how vassals will accept your rule but overall not that impactful.

Plagues are another new mechanic added to the game which is basically also not that impactful since plague strength isn't that optimized even at full strength. You'll see ""casualties"" pertaining to the plague in question but it'll usually fizzle out before even killing 100 people, which is kinda underwhelming. I had to tell my court physician not to help with the plague so that I could actually experience the mechanic on my city.

Let's get into fine details, shall we?

[h2]Plagues[/h2]

So, for the uninitiated, CK3 is a character-driven and focused RPG-meets-Sims game. Back when the game released 3 years ago, the design intent was to really invest into your characters, make them live long, have great education and congenital traits. The game really encouraged that with mechanics like Long/Short Reign, legacies like Octogenarians and Graceful Aging etc. However, a part of the community complained the game is not ""hardcore"" enough. As a result we got so called ""harm events"" in one of the updates, with the idea of randomly forcing death/crippling events on your characters and going completely against everything established previously. 

Plagues is the continuation of the trend. It adds the separate ""elderly heath"" stat to further cripple your characters beyond certain age, and otherwise all it does is randomly forces diseases on them. If previously my Rurik would live into his 60th - with this DLC he died in the early 50th from smallpox, and his son Helgi inherited at 27 and instantly got cancer. RIP. In the game where unplanned character death is akin to having your saves wiped it goes without saying how terrible these additions are. And the plagues are so constant that I eventually learned to live with them and ignore the constant buttons for ""Go into seclusion"" and ""Isolate the capital"" popping on my screen.

[h2]Legitimacy[/h2]

This mechanics is simple ""win more"" power creep that if you're a good player makes the game even easier and if you struggle makes it even worse for you. Win a few wars and do a feast and you notice it's easier to vassalize or make alliances. Lose a battle though, and you are hit with internal instability on top of that. Marry a beautiful lowborn girl and you're now hit with legitimacy penalty on top of the prestige one. The rising legitimacy expectations based on your rank are there to make it more difficult to keep kingdoms and empires together. However, this mechanics is superficial and in reality does little to change how the game is played. Like if you have the biggest army and the wealthiest domain around - you can pretty much forget legitimacy exists. 

[h2]Legends[/h2]

And this is a money sink. In the early game, maintaining and spreading a legend will cost you the money you could have spent on a large army, making it not really viable. And in the late game the rewards of the mechanics are pretty irrelevant. Imagine spending 3 legacy points to get a perk that grants your character a Saint trait, but you need to work for 100-200 years to complete a Mythic holy legend for it. The most important reward for legend completion are ""Legendary buildings"" - however those compete with existing Special buildings and Holy Sites for slots and end up being less powerful versions of those. This makes legends pointless if your domain is something like Paris or Rome, and while it could be useful if you want to make your domain in the middle of nowhere somewhat viable - you wouldn't have the funds to get it done in the first place. And the last reward is a book containing the legend (with random text which feels like written by ChatGPT) which only the character who completed the legend can commission for an additional sum of gold.

So there you have it - one mechanics that is harmful to the experience, one mechanics that is plain unnecessary, and one more that could be good if it wasn't half-baked and designed to be more than a money sink."

The pros are:

1) Plagues and Diseases are back. And they are a bit of fun.
2) It has some fun additions for Roleplaying purposes despite being more of a systemic pack.
3) The UI has gotten a lot better too. Espescially for some of the older mechanics as court positions.
4) While you could cheese Legitimacy and Legends it is more fun to let them run in a more role playing like style.

The cons are:

1) Legends could need more depth and there should be some more unique legends for many regions (Persia could need at least three more. Tibet also and why are things like the G√∂kturks not really a seed. I don't want to start with Africa).
2) Also there should be some ancestrial legends of your Dynasty in the late game.
3) The AI seems to have issues with legitimacy? I have the feel that they sometimes let it fall apart even with being able to avoid this situation.

Granted, a fair share of the core returning plague mechanics are part of the free ""scythe"" update, only some extra elements and more expanded bits are part of the DLC pack related to the plague mechanics such as funerals, additional varieties in plagues, more fleshed out Black Death. 

However the 2nd focus those being legends which sounded like about the same what we had with bloodlines in CK2's final update fall kinda flat due one major issue, there is no way extend a legend , legends you create for your character and dynasti fade away in mere years which makes no sense, this is an issue that honestly can very easily be fixed by simply increasing somewhat how long a legend can exist and adding some simple additional mechanic in which future generation can keep the family legends going and have them always be inherited. 

Due to to the issue of the bizarrely short legends, a lot of people who unlike me maybe weren't mainly excited for the plagues but instead for the legends mechanic were let down thus , this has dropped to mixed reviews but since i am someone who primarily was excited and focused on the plagues returning, the legends stuff was more of an extra side thing for me so it didn't bum me out when it turned out it has this weird design flaw that i do hope will be fixed.

So due to this, i am still really happy, i was so excited to see dynamic plagues and diseases come back , though i would suggest waiting for a bit of a discount on this DLC, it's more worth it for like 15 bucks, maybe a tad less, i did get mine from a 3rd party store where they had a slight discount dropping it to 15 which felt more fair then these bizzare new awful prices they hiked up for CK3 DLC a year or so ago.

I think the plague mechanics are fine, though the base system was added to the main game for free, so really you're just paying for a few extra potential negative modifiers, names of plagues, and one RNG event chain. Legitimacy is pretty interesting as well and makes the game more challenging by giving you more penalties for trying to marry Genius peasants into your bloodline. But, once again legitimacy was added to the base game for free so it's not something you're paying for. They're starting to add ""Sub-tasks"" that your court positions like the Physician can do, which is great and gives the player more control over their court, but once again that's free with the base game.

So, if most of the major features of the DLC are actually free with the base game, what do you get here? A couple of RNG event chains, a handful of new clothes, the ability to hold funerals, and Legends. Legends feels like something thrown together at the last second to justify this being a major update and ""Major"" DLC instead of a major update and minor DLC. Through the mechanic of ""Legends"" players are now supposed to be able to create lasting legends for their dynasty that make you out to be a hero, legitimize your dynasty's right to rule, or turn you into a saint among men. That all sounds great on paper, but in reality Legends are little more than an RNG gold sink. You have no real power over what your legend is about, what deeds it promotes, or what the final story will be, in fact the final legend feels like chatGPT was fed every memory of my character and then forced to spit out the most mundane drivel it could think of. 
""Here's the legend of how kind Midas walked two counties over to visit a church."" Meanwhile in my lifetime I united an entire kingdom and drove out a massive plague. The rewards for creating a Legend include an ok artifact, and a ""Legendary"" building. These legendary buildings compete for existing duchy buildings and are generally simply on par with what you can already build though they do have some nice models for the buildings. 
To top it off legends are not a permanent thing despite all the effort that goes into building them. Depending on how much money and effort you sunk into a legend it will stick around for between 20 and 100 years. That's right, you can create a ""Legend"" and still be alive when everyone has forgotten all about it. King Arthur who? Saint Edward, never heard of him. Now, I could see legends needing upkeep if the rewards were truly powerful, and the need to erase or supersede a legend to create a new one, but the fact that they're called LEGENDS and are forgotten in less than a generation is terrible design and it makes it feel pretty bad creating them.
CK2 already did legends better, they were called bloodlines. The devs need to take a look back at what they already did and improve upon it instead of creating worse, less interesting features.

Seeing my king create a legend at just 30 years old, only to see it totally disappear WHILE HE IS STILL ALIVE AND MAKING NEW CONQUESTS, sounds very stupid, doesn't it?

I hope that the community's comments will be listened to and that this problem will be solved, if not by Paradox then at least by the community itself (thanks to all the modders out there btw, you truly are the best that mankind can offer) which would save us again from a mechanic created and promptly abandoned.

It's become a real slog to get anything done while constantly being interrupted not just by the various plagues, but the various events these plagues tigger.

So the plague system is basically Reapers DLC from CK2; diseases and plagues are more deadly and have more consequences, which is excellent.

Unfortunately, the Legends system is poorly implemented; legends are costly to maintain yet do not last very long; aside from the most important legitimacy gain, there really isn't any reason to interact with the Legends system. 
As mentioned, Legends lasts a very short while after it's completed, and without dynastic interaction or any interaction with conquered land, the legends mechanic feels really hollow and shallow a system.

Legitimacy itself is also not anything interesting. Firstly, legitimacy gives buffs and debuffs, but does not affect the way claims are pushed if anything it feels more like short reign and long reign debuff and buff, respectively and feels redundant with the way it is implemented. 

Secondly the easiest way to gain legitimacy is through warfare, as other activities such as feasts, tours and weddinngs etc. are very costly. This now discourages play styles do not involve warfare, for example diplomacy and intrigue play styles will generate little to no legitimacy which almost guarantees that you will have to play the game with a major debuff.

The overall lack of depth doesn't bode well for Roads to Power, and at this point I'd bet my life with a gun to my head that DLC will be another disappointment; that will likely play exactly the same as the base game, while changing the names of your vassals from Kings and Dukes to some vaguely Greek synonym for Governor.

The legends are really quite stale. On top of that it's weird that you build up the legend yourself, as if a legend is some sort of ""top down"" thing in our world, rather than a story that gets passed around a community until it becomes something more than whatever event touched it off. I understand this is a video game, and that it is a representation of the world rather than a mirror of it, but this is so awkward and false in its execution, in its logic, that I cannot look past it. 

Legitimacy, a new mechanic meant to reflect how your community/realm views you, seems like a great idea at the start. Except there really was a mechanic for it already, in your relationship to individual characters. Legitimacy is, by a modern definition, the personal belief in the authority of a figure or an institution. Now instead of your character having a personal relationship with every other character, and that reflecting their individual loyalties to you as a ruler, their opinion is collated into a monolithic bar that you must seek to fill with video game points. 

Again, it is a reflection of a reality, rather than a mirror, but there was already a much better reflection in the game. One that was far more subtle. 

In truth this betrays an even greater problem with the game. What is the difference between authority and power? Power is the ability to make someone do something through threat of violence. Authority is the ability to command someone righteously. The Catholic Church, as portrayed in the game, is barely an entity. In reality, in the Middle Ages, it was the authoritative institution of the West. 

To have any legitimacy in a ruler, in a representation of the Christian West, the Church must be the authority to dispense that legitimacy. 

Feasts and hunts and fine robes do not a King make. Not in this place and this time period (or ever really). The authority of such things has to be lodged in something more than the material world. It has to come from a metaphysical ideal. In that regard, CK3 is like a scientific treatise. It proffers a neutral, sterilized view of the world in which the only recognized legitimacy at all is the ability and willingness to use violence to get what you want. 

I cannot recommend this until it is fleshed out. Until it has been cultivated into a finer experience. Money aside, it is simply not worth your time."

If you like to play count or duke and dare to marry a commoner you will instantly lose all your legitimacy and go into a death spiral of not being able to get rid of the penalties and none of your courtier can marry so you cannot get good courtiers and god forbid they die of old age or in combat or you will have literally no one left.
You are meant to get legitimacy by going to war and doing events but while between 0-100 you only sometimes get legitimacy going to war and about 10 for an event so good luck spamming feasts and hunts for 30 years and hope you can get out of the death spiral.
Finally the worst thing to come from this is certain starting character start with high legitimacy and so they have more power and they have the power to vassalize people even if those people are not de jure apart of their duchy or kingdom.

Legitimacy is centered around a character, and not around title, which renders the whole thing completely useless, apart from being a minor modifier. 
Also some of the rewards for completing a legend (e.g. legendary artifact commission) require your legend to be present, first of all legends disappear COMPLETELY without trace after two decades at most, and when you use your legendary adventure casus belli before creating the artifact, and go somewhere remote, you will never be able to complete that artifact. It happened to me and I am still mad about it.
Plagues are interesting, and definitely add a much needed threat for the player - but it still feels like it could have been better, and IMO outbreaks seem to be biased to happen in the player's territory, or at least in close proximity.
On top of that, full of bugs, and it's a shame that this is the expected standard by now from Paradox.

Also, minor detail, but, on release day, in the Developer Livestream there was a question from the community if Isolationist cultures get a bonus to plague resistance, which was affirmed by a Dev, but in the game, if this is true, there is no indicator for it in the cultural tradition. I doubt they actually implemented it. Could be a honest mistake, or could be an indicator for greater issues at Paradox.

I have tried to be as optimistic and fair as possible but I just cannot understand the praise this DLC gets from the community. Compare it to Bloodlines in CK2 and it's just a pure joke.

This DLC is not substandard, it is not terribly unbalanced or anything like that. It is simply... meh. Legends fade way too quickly, you would think the exalted among men emperor of the newly restored Roman Empire, who claims to be the son of a lynx and visited by god would be something remembered forever in the annuals of history? Nope, in about two generations literally everybody has forgotten about him- Not even a mention of his name. The legends are generic too which really doesn't help the situation. The best example of this is Ottar ""Die Vogel"" of house Babenberger, a legendary ruler who restored the Holy Roman Empire from a mere county in Wien, destroying his enemies and launching grand holy wars into England, overrun by heathens. 

This sounds awesome right? Something mentioned in his legend ""Battle of Cumberland"" the battle which decided the fate of Scotland, England and Ireland? Nope, the legend mentions how he visited Canterbury and some generic event where he is 'visited by god' which is actually just a 100 year old randomly generated lowborn character, it doesn't even get the details of the battle itself correct, Ottar had no reinforcements or aid from anybody, his snake-like Karling allies refusing to aid him in his noble quest for Christendom... yet it says here how the battle was nearly lost (which is correct until a battle roll went in his favour) until his horsemen (the only men at arms unit I hadn't invested in) smashed through the enemy Varangian heavy infantry... a unit that counters heavy horsemen.

The legends in short are painfully generic, nothing unique about them exists. All the origin legends detail about how you were born from a pool of Ragnarr Lothbrok or Arthur Pendragon's own 'flesh and blood'. Cool, until you see it again, and again, and again and then some more halfway across the world. These origin legends are pretty much exclusive to Europe too, nothing in Persia claiming to be from the ages of Darius, nothing in Greece about Alexander the GREAT, nothing about Genghis Khan after he falls, imagine how cool that would be? Nope.

To conclude, all the legends feel like they were written by chat GPT, nothing unique or interesting about them, to add insult to injury, Ottar's statue didn't even have his name on it, just generic flavour text about a ruler immortalized in stone. His legend faded and in 2 generations, the legendary ruler of the HRE, destroyer of heathens, incredible commander and wily as a hawk had faded into complete obscurity, the only reminder of his existence being a small statue in Cumberland with a popular opinion boost.

This DLC is a for sure buy when it is on SALE, otherwise, it has nothing of value to add to this game. I hope the next one is a bit better.

It really feels like a much, much worse version of bloodlines to me.

Legitimacy feels very poorly balanced and overall just punitive and removing of more player agency over their realm. Perhaps there can be a proper balancing of it but it really feels far more stick than carrot. The legitimacy hits from disinheriting for example are needlessly expensive, especially when it's having secondary children take the vows...

Disease meanwhile feels marginally less fleshed out than in CK2 reapers due, ESPECIALLY in terms of Hospitals and Plague vulnerability/resistance, the barony buildings really feel less enjoyable to engage with than Hospitals in CK2.

76561198089885315,2671060,False,0.542478442192077637,"edited cause after playing more its clear how shit of a mechanic legends are:

legends are the most half baked feature to come out of ck3 yet. even court artefact spamming has some level of interaction with it, but legends are truly awful. its start legend, wait for a bit, mindlessly click through event spam about it (I have seen the same event 4 separate times in the same playthrough for multiple events), click button to upgrade, repeat this step again, then click complete, get some generic bonuses or some region specific claims, and now you can never use this legend again for the rest of the game. 

that's right, in a game about dynastic succession, about seeing how each character's actions build onto each other, only one character in your entire dynasty can use a legend seed. according to this dlc, if Louis the stammerer claimed to be the decedent of Charlemagne, none of his line afterwards could EVER claim the same again. the biggest middle finger to the player? after all is said and done, and you complete your so called 'legend', not only does it die off the map completely in just a few decades, but you cant even read the chronicle. that's right, the devs who claim this is a role-playing game as an excuse for giving us barely any mechanics besides event spam for 3 years, have the main role-play feature of their new dlc straight up disappear from player view almost instantly.
 
the common sense way to do this is have legends actually affect your dynasty long term, and give them a set of standards to adhere too to appear more like their claimed ancestor. If you want people to see you as the heir of Charlemagne, defeat the Saracens in battle, have a group of famed knights who you ride into battle with, be crowned by the pope, defeat rebellious vassals, etc. if you fail at these things, people will see you as not living up to your claimed ancestry, giving worse penalties then failing these things normally. the worst part is that most of these issues cant be fixed by modding. I have looked into (and posted) a mod that tries to fix legends, but with how fundamentally flawed the system at its core, a mod can only put a bandied on the bullet wound.

plagues are pretty solid, if deadly (as they should be to an extent), but could have used a bit more depth which they could have gotten if resources were not wasted on the abysmal legends system. pretty self explanatory tbh, if you have played ck2, they are not too different

as for bugs, I have noticed some with the new sound effects (which im not a fan of compared to the old), and some bigger ones, like a random unlanded character occupying land for some inexplicable reason.

overall legends are awful, being yet another event spam coated with an unintuitive ui over it, and the additions the dlc gives to plagues are not worth it, as most of the new plague mechanics are base game. skip if you didn't buy chapter 3, and if you were like me and got blinded by byzantine empire and landless hype and instantly clicked buy on chapter 3, lets pray that they make up for this. ck3 cant (or rather shouldn't) survive another year of disappointments like the last few."

76561198074094951,1235140,True,0.575163185596466064,"Overall: 7/10

I would give a higher ranking just because of the story but the gameplay was kind of annoying as I explain in the cons... Don't take me wrong this was my first Yakuza game and I am not into this franchise, I will play the older ones for sure and even more excited since the gameplay is different from this one. 
Pro:

Story is pretty compelling (actually the only reason i finished the game), the main story is very compelling and it gets your attention pretty fast, it has some amazing plot twists that I was not expecting at all ! The side quests and side stories are quite good as well, I came across with some little quests that made me interested it the world that I was playing in. 

Funny little games around town and in side quests. Friends told me this is the Yakuza games style and I loved it, will not tell examples so I don't spoil but you get pretty crazy mini-games that are cool to take you off the grind of the main quest.

Character development is pretty good, since you have the relationship lvl you get to know even more about the characters or by little funny things or a bonding moment between the main character and them. In the main story you get development in the side characters that make the plot even deeper and give a more personal and sentimental touch to the characters which was pretty amazing.

The city is pretty well designed with something interesting in all the corners, funny little events and things to do everywhere.

Cons:

Tedious gameplay, 30 min of cutscenes, 1 hour of continuous fighting all the same thing over and over again. This is due to the fact that the ""dungeons"" are made for you to fight every single group... It gets boring, taking into consideration that it is a turn based game you get to attack or defend once and then it is your opponent turn, it is not so much skill based, if you get to fight 30 enemies without having the option to heal except to use one of your turns to heal (when your healer is not stunned, sleeping, dazed, etc, etc) it gets annoying as hell...

Running around the street can get annoying with the groups, some times I wanted to go to an alley and all the passages were blocked by a group and when I fought them ANOTHER group spawned in the same alley!!!

The skill progression is kinda bland, you get something new rarely and that makes the fights all the same, wile using the same stronger ability.

Leveling up is SUPER annoying, I was stuck on the main story because of a Boss that was 2 levels ahead of me and was hard like a tank, I tried to lvl up on the streets with groups and side quests and dugeons and nothing, I hardly leveled up it was super tedious taking into account that the main story have some weird power creep that makes your party weak even tho you are 2 lvl behind. 

Final thoughts:
If you ignore the annoying parts the game is very good and a good introduction to the Yakuza games, it will make you interested in the franchise like it did to me. The finale of the game makes you want to continue the journey of Ichiban right away but pursue to know more about the story behind the Yakuza itself in the older games."
76561198117638988,1235140,False,0.572555899620056152,"A very solid game if there wasn't so much unnecessary grind. 

Enemies at the same level are very different in strength and from halfway through the game some bosses become an unbelievable damage sponge. 
You kick the same enemy in the face for 30 minutes only to be KO'd in one hit just before the end despite blocking and full HP. Especially the last bosses of the last 3 chapters were very good at this. 

Saving before the boss room is not an option either. 
I don't understand why saving is restricted, as it only meant that I had to repeat the same things several times just to try a new strategy in a boss fight. 

To avoid this, there's an arena at the end of the game that's designed solely for repeating the same 30 waves of enemies until your level reaches that of a boss you try to beat. 
I hope I don't have to explain that it's no fun to fight the same enemies for hours on end so that your level is higher, and I think it's a shame that the game is designed that way.

There are also no difficulty options in this game to counteract the grind. 

Especially towards the end, I just wanted to finish the game and see the end of the story. 
I thought about quitting the last few bosses and watching the ending on YouTube, but I went through with it.

The game is often discounted and then definitely worth a look but not for the full price.
If you're looking for a JRPG, I would definitely recommend Persona 5 Royal, even at full price, if you don't mind the anime style."

Kind of issues such as the relatively unbalanced tempo, the combat AI of your party being dumb and the grinding requirement which is boring. When it comes to the combat, I must say I was expecting something more similar to SMT/Persona or Dragon Quest which is frequently mentioned in the game. Despite many moments that massacre the vibe, the story is decent. It tells about the importance of bonding and makes you practice it. Lastly, mini games and side activies were fun as always.

76561197984338378,1235140,True,0.506666660308837891,"The torch is passed. After playing the prior Yakuza games, I can say it's no small feat to cook up a way to replace Kiryu: physically, he's a wall of dragonforce albums (please recognize the ancient meme) and RGG has to cook up someone equally as strong as him every time they need a bad guy. How on earth do you make someone that fits the same bill as Kiryu?

You don't make one person.

Y7 moves to turn-based RPG-like gameplay from the brawling we're used to in prior installments. Ichiban isn't as stoic as Kiryu and doesn't have the same fighter DAWG that Kiryu had in him; the spirit is there but there's no innate crazy strength. In order to stand toe to toe with the giants in his path, Ichiban is joined by a colorful entourage of misfits and outcasts just like himself, and with a little help from his friends Ichiban overcomes challenge after challenge. I like that the game captures this time and time again: Kiryu would have an even clash with an opponent while Ichiban has a punch or a kick absorbed or deflected by his unfazed opponent, but with some tag-team insanity, even the greatest giants kneel to Ichi.

I like Ichiban himself a lot. He's flawed in both obvious and subtle ways that make him seem human versus Kiryu: Ichi's hotheaded, sometimes lacking common sense, caring to a fault, stubborn, the list goes on. His growth as a character is a bit more relatable and direct versus Kiryu's more muted displays through his saga. What's nice is that Ichi doesn't have any shortage of heroic moments in comparison to Kiryu, and Ichi still has a good head on his shoulders filled with street smarts, so we're not just watching some loser get carried from being a yakuza castoff from a bygone generation.

The sidestories I naturally encountered were nice, though a scant few are kind of bland. They really help tie Ichiban to the Yakuzaverse and some of them are straight-up goofy, keeping in line with the wild charm of the series. The party chats and their sidestories also help everyone seem realistic and give the cast personality and credibility: I think some of my favorites were [spoiler]Adachi's Hobbies[/spoiler] and the [spoiler]laundry day chat[/spoiler].

The game isn't without fault. I think the rpg-like combat is done a disservice by the free-roaming the cpus do in a given arena, so while it isn't game-destroying, it's annoying to see a strategy be lost to the sands of semi-rng because two enemies moved slightly farther apart as you were getting ready to send an AOE attack command. The ragdolling is also a little ridiculous because if your character trips or knocks an opponent too hard with some multi-hit attacks, they'll miss out on damage. This does go both ways so sometimes it works in your favor. I'm torn on whether or not it's more annoying or funny to watch your attack knock an enemy so far back you lose out on the effect of the move.

If you don't plan to play NG+, [spoiler]Romance Workshop[/spoiler] loses value insanely fast for how much you have to put into it. A lot of the jobs suck and there's little motivation to deviate from each character's stock job unless you're really into Y7 and want to do job runs. [spoiler]Eri[/spoiler] can become insanely overpowered just from leveling normally, which isn't a huge problem in and of itself. However, when you combine this with how annoying reistances are and how weapons with elemental effects fall off by the 2/3rds mark of the game, it's kind of stupid. A lot of mini-boss and boss fights in the game are DPS checks more than strategy (mixing jobs, items, elemental effects, etc.) checks: great examples are [spoiler]the fight against Kiryu[/spoiler] and [spoiler]both fights against Ishioda[/spoiler]. Then, you level up and acquire armor from the later-game fights to where the final fights feel almost trivial in comparison.

Regardless, Yakuza 7 has found its new hero and is an excellent addition to the series that you should play. In-game save says I have 67+ hours logged, so ignore the 90+ hours Steam recorded with me alt-tabbed, but know you'll get your money's worth."

Made a couple of cities, my most advanced one being at roughtly 65,000 inhabitants, so I feel confident I've seen enough of the game to have some comments. 

The game is not finished. That's plain to see. And some decisions that were made in the design phase are very questionable to me.

[h2] Technical aspects [/h2]
Performance is sub-par, even at low population. I get 30-50 FPS on my 3070Ti 12th-gen  i7 at 2K resolution, medium settings.

Graphically, the game look ok but not spectacular and there are LOTS Of graphical glitches, from the wheels of vehicles looking funky to shadows looking pixelated or flickering in and out of existence. Same goes with terrain and roads.

I haven't had any crash or freezes, so there's that at least. It seems to be stable enough at least on my hardware.

[h2] Gameplay [/h2]

Most of the concepts of CS1 are repeated in CS2 so I won't go over them. A few key differences: 

Power: 

You don't need to lay power lines or pipes everywhere. Road connections now include power and plumbing. I actually like this very much. Less of a hassle, more time spent on management (at least in theory). 

You still have some power management to do however as the power conduits in roads have limited capacity. As the city grows, you will need to build power distribution centers and connect them with high voltage power lines. I'm fine with that. 

What I'm not fine with is how difficult it is to connect regular (small) power lines. If you try to connect them to wind generators it will constantly tell you it's overlapping and won't let you connect the power line unless you get it just right. The previous system where you could just plop a power line NEAR them was much better.

Network: 

Road laying has its own set of annoyance. On one hand, you can now see the angle of the intersections as you lay the road. On the other hand, the snapping doesn't lock nearly as well as in the previous game and it will constantly be off by a couple of degrees, which will f- up the zoning. Sometimes it doesn't even need to be off, the zoning will be off anyway. More on that later.

I have not experimented with railroads yet so I won't comment on that. 

Bus lines are more of a pain as before because you now have to manually build bus shops and shelters THEN use the bus line tool and make the line stop at the stops you built. That's one more step than before and feels unnecessary.

Sea and air now require you to build a path, which is only possible on tiles you own. This means you have to waste city expansion slots on empty sea tiles to connect your port to the outside world. WHY?! How was that a good idea?

Zoning: 

Some of the zoning issues that existed in CS1 are still present, namely, the ""squares"" being exactly that, squares. This means whenever the angle between two roads is not exactly 90 degrees, you lose some of that space. I would have hoped that Colossal Order would have figured out a more realistic zoning method, but no. Add to that how weirdly the game handles street angles and snapping and getting a nice, straight and even grid-type zoning becomes a nightmare.

Zoning demand makes no sense to me. Commercial demand is ALWAYS skyrocketing, now matter how many commercial buildings will say ""not enough customers"" or how many you zone. The same goes for low density residential zones. You can cover the map with them, the demand is still all the way up.

Replacing low-density commercial with high-density commercial seems to make little different with demand (maybe they should be separate like residential demand is?).

At least office and industrial demand are now separate, which makes a lot more sense than having them being one and the same in the previous game did.

[h2] Management [/h2]

Happiness: Seems broken. Buildings and houses will be abandoned due to unhappiness despite having all factors far in the Pluses and only one factor at -4 or something, and even as the global happiness is maxed out. In fact, in either CS1 or CS2, I have never seen the global happiness indicator be anything other than maxed out.

Power and water supply/demand seem to fluctuate in a way I have not yet been able to figure out. More investigation needed on that before I can say something. I suspect it has to do with temperature (colder means more power usage), wind speed, etc.

One thing I find weird is that the community radio will sometimes warn you about a water/power shortage, but when you look at your data, everything is in the green. This makes me think there might be a bug where supply will plummet for no reason for a very short amount of time.

Overall, just like the previous one, the game is extremely easy. You build the city, money and population will come, you keep building it. Rinse and repeat. Little to no challenge. It's a chill game.

[h2] Features [/h2]

A few added mechanics that were not in the previous game at all are interesting, like having to provide telecommunications and mobile coverage. I hope this gets expanded as it's very much a two-click affair to deal with.

Very few recreational and touristic buildings to build. Probably will be improved with a DLC but even with that in mind, it feels very limited

[h2] Final Thoughts [/h2]

Wait for a few patches, maybe a couple DLCs. You know there will be a million.

[b]Performance[/b]: 3/5 - Kind of a resource hog at present, FPS seem low without justification
[b]Graphics[/b]: 3/5 - Adequate, could be much better especially given the aforementioned hit in performance. Very little visual variety IMO
[b]Gameplay[/b]: 3.5/5 - A few annoyances with laying roads and zoning is why I took out 1.5 point there.
[b]Features[/b]: 4/5 - A few added features, a few others that seem limited. Overall still one of the game's few strong suits, shockingly

[b]Overall[/b]: 3.5/5 - Saying the basics are there is being generous given the multiple issues with them. The game has a long road ahead of it before becoming genuinely enjoyable."
76561198149764643,949230,False,0.566891252994537354,"It's not that I DISLIKE this game, it really boils down to a few major issues for me personally (as someone with hundreds of hours in CS1 and approaching 100 in CS2):

- The game is not even close to finished (everything looks the same), currently no bike paths or expanded gameplay. It is as bare-bones as it could be right now. Building a city means nothing because the simulation is broken and the cities provide no realism, despite the fact that the game was marketed to us as some incredible living and breathing sim.
- Developers continue to push back major features like integrated modding support and give wish-washy answers as to why the game launched in an abysmal state + zero legitimate updates on how long it'll take them to get it working. Any time frame they've given us thus far has shown to be unreliable. Honestly this game should've been delayed by at least a year in order to make it actually functional.
- The game performs horribly regardless of your build. I spent thousands on my gaming PC and even in basic 1080p you can't get this game to solidly run at 30fps, let alone 60. It's pathetic that this game several months into being on the market has had no substantial upgrades to performance.

I love Cities Skylines, and I like(d) these developers before this, but they've just proven to me time and time again that I can't trust their word for anything and they're more than willing to push a game out for sales if it means they have to cut corners. Very disappointing that this game likely won't actually be playable for AT LEAST another year/year and a half - and that once again is if you trust the developers, which I no longer do.

Don't get this game."

76561198113706417,949230,False,0.549098193645477295,"If I could go back and refund the game, I would. Paradox and Colossal don't care about their fans anymore. I made the common mistake of pre-ordering a game in the 2020's, I thought that Paradox cared about their adoring fanbase and wouldn't disrespect them with an unfinished, buggy, unoptimized mess... I was wrong.

Before the game released they had an event where popular YouTubers were invited to play the game early, IN THE AIR ON A BLIMP. Mind you these are YouTubers have probably never played the game unless it was trendy, so that was a massive smack in the face to YouTubers who do make CS content on a consistent basis.

Secondly. On release the performance was so bad, even high-level PC's had a hard time running this game. The performance now isn't terrible, not not great either. The game looks good, and there's some improvements to AI and systems I enjoy, but overall it's not too much different than CS1.

To add insult to injury, Colossal basically victimizes themselves and thinks criticism of their game is ""toxic"", it's pathetic. They don't take responsibility for their actions, they just deflect it. I hope they get that stick out of their ass and start treating their fanbase with respect.

Thanks to CS2 for $50 I'm never getting back.

Every building asset looks the same. Transit is broken, subways are a joke because they made the underground footprint of stations ginormous and with no real way to overlap platforms over each other, you cannot make any meaningful transfer stations. Traffic simulation is horrendous with no way to create left turn lanes, advanced greens for turn lanes, or anything really to customize intersections. All the things we had from popular mods from CS:1 should have been implemented here. The grid system is BROKEN. You can make 2 streets perfectly perpindicular, yet it will break up the zoning grids for no reason. Horrible implementation of zoning.

I understand this game is not complete and will be as more updates are introduced including DLC's. At this current moment 3/15/24 Cities Skylines 1 is simply a better game that just offers more. It's not difficult to notice that this game really wasn't ready to be released. The type of glitches and issues we are seeing with this game including frame rate isn't really an issue we should be seeing from such a famed developer like Colossal Order Ltd. 

The main improvement I've noticed is improvements to how vehicles interact with roads and buildings but they still don't like default parking lots just like in CS:1. Besides that things appear to mainly have been just moved around or simply just removed from the game entirely. One of the other pros that need to be mentioned is that you can upgrade your public services buildings which was one of my main complaints regarding CS:1.


My recommendation? If you want a game BETTER then CS:1 you should wait as this game simply in it's current state is not and you WILL be disappointed in what you get. If you don't care if it's better or not then it may be worth it for you.

Started playing this game a long time ago. If you want to have fun play against the braindead AI and blow some ships and then leave. Dont go into random battles above t4. This game is a cash grab and higher ranks are nothing but getting insta killed and landing a few really good volleys and all of them are bounced shells.

1.Game is unbalanced.
2.Game matches are horrible t7s can be in with t9s.
3. Luck is all that matters.
4. Battleships. Plan shoot, and watch your volleys do no damage, bounce or do little damage. Do not read what the ships are supposed to be good at. 
5. Want to hear a good joke, Secondaries. You have to be within 13km for them to start firing and do almost nothing. Thats the BEST secondary battleships with the BEST commander with max points which take AGES to farm for. 
5. Crusisers? Yeah they are horrible low tier, high tier kicks ass. Only fun in the whole game.
6. Destoryers? Want to not have range or turning speed, have massive hit boxes and be completely exposed, while looking for torpedoes for your allies? Did I mention your match will also last all of 5min, the first 4 min being getting into position. 
7. Aircraft carriers. If you can get to high tier are game breaking and cannot be truly countered properly. Destoryers are supposed to protect the battleships but never do so your almost always a sitting duck.
8. Stay with your group. At least you die all together.

There is nothing fun about the game when trying to play battleships at high tier.Want to always feel like your loosing and get a better ship only to find out its worst then the last and you have to use it to get to the next one? 
Want an endless grind where the few things that are fun are on timer because if they where not then thats all people would play so are forced into pvp that is horribly implemented.

Want to find something fun about the game or actually find a decent ship only to have it patched out? 

Everything about this game after t4 pvp is horrible. Anything after t6 is horrible period. Cool ships. Cool sounds. HORRIBLE GAMEPLAY and HORRIBLE PVP.

DO NOT PLAY."
76561198098243009,552990,False,0.523809552192687988,"I could write an essay about all the reasons nobody should play this game, but I'll try to save myself (and everyone else) the time and just give the short version.

-Its playerbase. Playing a submarine in this game gets the same treatment rapists would get in prison, with more than a few humanoids devolving into behavior that downright becomes cyberbullying. Examples include, but not limited to:
   -telling you that submarine players should have their wives and girlfriends be community property
   -publicly rejoicing when the enemy gangs up on your submarine and sinks it with a depth charge spam at speeds and frequency that should be outright impossible. Mind you, most of this rejoice will come from the sub player's [i]own[/i] team
   -looking up your profile and stats before a match even [i]begins[/i], basically stalking you that turns into open harassment the moment you make a mistake or dare open your mouth.
   -said harassment may continue post game, adding the sub player in question as their contact just to flame them some more, again, squarely falling into cyberbullying territory
   -subs can't even detect destroyers half the time before one of them spots the sub, which is braindead stupidity for multiple reasons, not in the least because as soon as it is detected, within 5 seconds the depth charge spam begins
   -the only reason subs are not sunk [i]bytheir own ""teammates""[/i] is because there's no friendly fire element in this game. If there was, subs would be sunk before a match even begins and the game as a whole would implode under the weight of its own hatred
   -and the list goes on

-The preview video is a big fat lie, since it claims to have hundreds of different ships to play, but in reality, people will see the same dozen or so every single match. This is particularly prevailent with ships like Scharnhorst '43, Yorktown or Yamato to name a few, which is partially explained that the matchmaking system tries to keep same tiered ships pitted against one another, but seeing the same ships the 1000th time nevertheless becomes incredibly boring after a while.
-Game economy is set up, so that end game ships simply cannot be played without paid economic bonuses because of the massive upkeep costs the game forces on those owning them. Allegedly, this is to prevent people from playing only tier X ships, but that's a lie because it's simply because the devs didn't have the balls to paywall even those, since the game already has the [i]""Premium ships[/i] category

-The grind is insane, especially without economic bonuses and/or if you don't play often. Once you pick a nation or alliance you're stuck with it, since even if you change your mind and want to try a different one you'll have to start over even if you sell the ships you don't want. Some of the credits may be earned back that way, but as far as I can tell, research point can't, which are used to unlock new ships before buying them.

-You might ask if there's even any reason to play this game at all, and I suppose the graphics are fairly nice. If you don't count the fact that zooming in onto the ships you won't see any moving figures, so you're basically controlling drones. But who cares about the small things, amiright?

All in all, this game is more cancerous in some ways than League of Legends. Unless you intend to waste your time, you're better off staying away.

76561198080965267,513710,False,0.523010432720184326,"Only started playing after 0.95, 1 month in playing can already felt that the game is lacking in so many different ways, in comparison to many other younger early access game, and I'm very surprised that it's already 5 years in the development cycle.

1. New player's experience: it did not felt good. Definitely experienced everyone's first or second death, which is not knowing how to deploy your parachute and landed on your face. You get thrown into the map without any new player guide or starting zone, everything was too hard to figure out just by exploring. It only started to make sense only after I had someone who played the game before taught it to me.

2. Difficulty: it's the same across the world. Of course it's more difficult inside the bunker, but what I mean is, no matter the Biome, they're the same zombie, therefore new player who hasn't figure out how to get a weapon yet, will not be able to kill any zombie with bare hand, but once you know what you're doing, you will do so well in killing the same zombie when you first encounter, the only difference is the spawn rate in certain poi.

3. Feature: this game is very feature lacking. Yes it's early access, but a lot of other younger games has already done more for a fair comparison than this 5 years old EA.
- You want survival? There's none. It's incredibly hard to encounter an animal, even if you got lucky and hear one nearby, it's either glitched to the ground (which you can't see, or you can see but will disappeared upon death), or it'll lead you to 3 more zombie spawned before you're able to get closer to the animal. Even if you've successfully killed something and cooked it, it won't fill you up, you get hungry so fast anyway and constantly has to eat and drink so much. Fruit and vegetable won't fill up much either. After I understood the game, the way to survive is just to grind for gold and go to the shop to buy the overpriced food from the store. You know, it cost as much as selling a gun.
- Cooking: I looked up a beginner's guide about cooking, well.... none of them work, apparently they scraped the cooking system in 0.95 and only skewer works, killed a fat chicken but can't even cook and eat the drumsticks, only 2 made skewers that has 2 charges each, which is not enough to fill 2 adults from a single chicken? Not to mention that I also have to stare at the timer during the whole cooking process, in which I could already be starving and ate 2 bowls of cereal before eating the skewer. 
- Building: too many things that will despawn once you placed it out WITHIN THE FLAG area. Found a lantern? Nah, good luck remembering to put it back into the storage every single time or it'll be gone next time you log back in. Not enough building pieces allowed within the claimed area, even if you're building for a squad of few people, you'll have to buy more land expansion but it doesn't give you much more to work with. It's not a game for you if you're into survival building where you want to build a separate room for everything (for example, kitchen, Armor, weapon, crafting + player's room). It's a building only for just enough to get by. Maintaining the base is also a pain, the durability lost so fast that you'll have to constantly repairing it.
- Crafting: overly convoluted and complicated. Not many things can be crafted too. The only thing that I crafted a lot is.... improvised repair kit to repair the base.
- Vehicle: well... it's incredibly hard to get one in P v E. It's limited by the fixed number of a certain type allowed in the server, so in most days, you just walk, and they have a short despawn rate of 5 days. Good luck going on a holiday that is more than 5 days.

4. Balance: horrible. For example:
- Player stat drains too fast (I'm looking at you, constitution). In reality, after your workout, you need to rest your body, the recover day will also burn energy after you worked your muscle; but in this game, as soon as you stopped moving, you started to drain your constitution. Although slowly, but it isn't fair, because sometimes I could be standing still to chop wood and that IT IS hard work too, it burns a lot of energy to do it!
- Horde spawn/normal spawn rate is abysmal. Re-spawn rate is super fast. You killed one 3 seconds ago, another one spawned, good luck in clearing and area because that will never happen. It'll spawn on a spot that you just cleared or walked on behind you. Sometimes after you finally managed to clear a room, another wild zombie spawned out of line of sight somewhere in a different room and immediately called a horde, from where?????? It's like they spawned and immediately saw us regardless of the wall in between us. The horde came quick and BIG!!!! I've experienced upon approaching a police station, we stopped 1 blocked away and walked in, we'd kite the zombie that we can see with a baseball bat and a bow that has 2 silencers in it, but it somehow spawned a horde of 50. Even if we killed the first wave, we opened the door and most zombies inside the building would notice us and charges on us, so we back out to the safer ground, yeah another horde of 50 would be called. We killed the 2nd horde, finally started to loot. half way looting, some zombie spawned somewhere outside of the building and called on a 3rd horde of 50 on us. All of this is on official server. I just can't be bothered to login now because what's the point if the reward vs risk is not balanced. 
- Using gun is a curse. First shot will immediately draw you a horde of 50. Is not like I don't want to use the gun, I just can't use it unless I want to commit suicide or having too many bullets on me to burn.
- The character eats like a cow, it's an eating simulator. Realistically, you don't require that much food to survive unless you're someone who has an eating disorder? Like I've mentioned above, how much you require to eat just to get by the day isn't realistic at all.
- The durability of the majority of items wear out too fast. This game is also a repair simulator. Base require constant repair. Clothes need to be repaired after every single trip. Weapon I can understand. But how does the canteen got beat up so much after few trips? Are you sure they're military grade not made of cheap plastic? Why is bank card decaying too? They're inside a pocket, which usually they'd last for years!
- Why clothes get 100% of dirtiness so quickly, but a full bar of soap of 20 charges, can't even clean a single piece of it to 100%?
- There's no point looting in town anymore. Like what I've mentioned above that, the re-spawn rate of zombie is too fast and the horde is crazy. Even if it's just a normal building nor police station, the risk is so much higher now that it's not worth looting the normal building anymore (I've even tried the small village). It's not same as what they claimed that the normal building is for new players who has nothing with them. You have to be an experienced player in order to loot the town now.

5, Glitch: zombie will glitch through the wall or any object while they spawned. I've seen them only has the head like a Diglet rushing toward me, and a beeper who I can hear it getting closer but cannot see where it was coming from until it was too close. They can also have part of their legs glitching (jumping) in and out of the boulder rapidly making it hard for me to aim, Oh yeah, sometimes they float in the air with a stiff motion until they reached your destination, but don't assume that you're safe if they are landing far, because they've already seen you. As soon as you hear anything or see any Diglet, run because they've already seen you while they were floating.

So no, I do not recommend this game,"

When you loot any puppet you cant use anything from them because its durability is like 5%. you can loot an entire town and not find any food, equipment or usable items, and when you do find a good item, you don't have inventory space because the horrible inventory system, and lack of backpacks. The QOL is near zero. crafting is too finicky.. enemy spawns are crazy random. I have not seen an animal yet. So no food! Maybe a few updates with QOL improvements it will be better. MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE PLAYER NOT HARDER!
This game has potential, where the devs take it from here will make or break it.

76561198122282822,1716740,False,0.603825986385345459,"Whilst many of the downfalls of Starfield have already been pointed out by others, and I completely agree with them, I want to draw some attention to one of the aspects of the game that made me switch off after 8 hours that doesn't get talked about much - the bland and repetitive questing.

In Skyrim, every dungeon was different. Yeah the format was the same - go through, fight some Draugr, find a dragon claw, open the door, beat a boss, get a shout - but we didn't complain about that because it was FUN. It was enjoyable and rewarding to traipse through dungeons and find money and gems lying around, to find weapons and secrets and be ultimately rewarded with a fun boss fight and a shout to add to your collection as well as some cool gear. 

Furthermore, in the questing side of things right from the start in Skyrim you're sent to different places - you go to Bleak Falls Barrow, then you fight a dragon, then you go to the Greybeards, then to the place where you find that horn they want, then to the Blades etc. The point is - there's variation, it's fun and keeps you engaged whilst feeding back into the established game loops of levelling and progression - this genuinely does JUST WORK. 

Let's now compare this to Starfield. I wanted to get through the main quests and get to a position where I was established in the game, in an immersion sense. In Skyrim I like to get to the point where I have got the whole of Fus Ro Dah and then start doing other quests, so that I'm actually the Dragonborn, ya know? I wanted to get to the equivalent place in Starfield, whatever that meant. So to do this, I started focusing on the main quests where you have to find those pointless and boring scraps of metal for whatever reason.

For the first one, I remember touching down on an incredibly barren and empty, boring planet, making my way from the artificially injected landing point, over the barren landscape completely on foot, to then another artificially injected facility or bunker where the mission marker lead me. I remember fighting through the first level beating mindless goons at almost no difficulty, then going through the next more underground level to find the scrap of metal. Great, I thought, that's that done thank god. I then remember going back to the boring gang you shack up with, giving them the metal thing and then hoping the next mission would be more enjoyable. 

What do I know, though? I then find myself on the 2nd mission, landing on the exact same barren, empty planet which was just re-skinned a different colour, with different resources arbitrarily scattered around and the same boring facilities to fight through, only they had clearly been substituted out with other procedural parts of the base and the goons were functionally the same but had different names. I was genuinely just so shocked by this, surely they don't expect me to do exactly the same thing again just with a different coat of paint that I can see straight through? Then I did the same mission for the 3rd time. And then the 4th

The problem here, is that it's all SO obvious. In Skryim there is clearly a pool of events and interactions that can happen, that the game then draws from randomly and that's how you get the fun of seeing two hunters fighting a bear on the road, or a bandit ambush, or a dragon attack. The difference is, that felt organic and natural. In Starfield, everything is so painfully forced and obvious - there's no finesse at all, you can see the systems in play just by experiencing the game and that's a massive red flag. You fight through the same bases, on the same planets, to accomplish the same thing, only it has a different coat of paint every time and they expect you to enjoy it. 

This would be fine if any aspect of it was actually fun. If the planet was gorgeous and thriving with things to do and people to see, then I could forgive the boring dungeons. If the combat was challenging and fun and varied then I could forgive the boring planets. It got to the point where on the 3rd dungeon of the same type, I just no-clipped through the level to get to the end. I didn't want to experience what the game wanted me to, and again, that's a massive red flag.

Boring, uninspired, factitious, and shockingly arrogant. That's what I'd use to describe Starfield. They had this game, using these bare-faced systems, and they genuinely thought people would enjoy it. Skyrim is my favourite game of all time, but it's clear Bethesda have lost the magic of making a game like that, and I couldn't be less excited for The Elder Scrolls 6. 

Don't touch Starfield - it rewards you with nothing, inspires no feelings within you and the fact that people gave it the most innovative gameplay award is so hilariously accurate"

The only area of starfield that I was really impressed with was the gun play, but that was just to Bethesda standards. I could go play any number of other games with far better gun play, but I want to play a Bethesda game. However almost every part of what makes a Bethesda game enjoyable is either missing or hidden behind 40 hours of game play and hundreds or even thousands of loading screens.

 I have a fairly good answer on why this game is just not good enough! It never makes you feel part of this universe, like Skyrim does, and there are several reasons for it.
 In Starfield the a.i is just too static, you dont get the feeling, with npc's from cities or communities or whatever, that they have a life.
 Comparing with Skyrim, npc's had a house, a lot of them had a backstory, they had the key to their houses, sat at their tables to eat and slept in their beds. Stores opened and closed... Overall in terms of npc's in settlements, Starfield is very dull.
 You dont get a sense of place as well, it's not like you ever get the real feeling of knowing something well, like, I Whiterun for example, it was intricate, had it's secrets and memories, you never build this in Starfield, you always feel, out of place, in a fake world, never totally able to get completly 'lost' in this world.
 You spend too long in loading menu's, I understand why, but, we, as players, we dont care about that, we just care about how it feels, it breaks the glue that connects the different lands in the planets, and the different planets and starts... I know to a certain extent this is the same in Skyrim, but, feels different, feels cheaper and very superficial.

- It is literally 50% loading screens or more
- Combat and exploration are boring, especially the exploration. Imagine playing a game set in space and the space exploration is the most half-baked and annoying part of the game.
- The world-building and the NPCs have this odd lobotomized feel, something within the game feels sinister. Except there's no giant, Lovecraftian horror alien living under whatever the main city is called, it's just so lackluster that it feels evil.
- The main story gets locked by mandatory skills forcing you to grind, that's fine, the main story sucks anyways, however, the main story puzzles suck even more. It's like finding Dragon Shouts but imagine to get the shout, you have to walk 15 minutes on foot on a lifeless looking planet, to get to a Mass Effect Andromeda (this is also a space game, but this space game has cars and aliens) Remnant Dungeon, except there's no dungeon or anything, and you just float around a couple times in a cave and then get powers. Then imagine that further, you encounter this exact same scenario with no variation at all, multiple times, maybe like 15 or more times.
- There's tons of game breaking bugs and I don't want to download 100 mods to fix a $70 triple a game. (The budget for this game was $200 million dollars.)

+ I like the setting, the main cities and locations are distinct, the NASA aesthetic is charming, and I love the Firefly/Dark Matter/The Expanse/Killjoys SYFY-feel. However, the game isn't theatrical at all, even compared to these budget science fiction stories. There's no depth, there's no grit, there's no stakes, it feels like your character makes no impact, the main story has no impact either. The music has more exposition than the whole game.
+ There were some fun quests (the UC Vanguard recruitment quest, the Crimson Fleet heists), there's a zero g level, a creepy multiverse level, a prison map, some Wild Wasteland type encounters, that was all great but too few.
+ You can have parents (trait). They say like 5 things and they still have more depth than 90% of the other NPCS. I like how the Adoring Fan (trait) was in the game. The Constellation members are cool, but I don't remember much about them aside from the ship CEO dude that looks like the Illusive Man that gets you a ship.
+ Ship building was ok, ship combat is ok, I wish there was more variation of the two. Bigger ships and bigger ship battles. Honestly, I wish there was more of everything, because you would get to somewhere that looked amazing and the NPCs told you about the place beforehand, hyping that shit up, but as soon as you explore, it becomes husk-like. It is a two-dimensional 3D game.
+ Space RPGs are hard to come by, and if you're a sci-fi fan or a fan of RPGs like me, you'll play it anyway. But there are limits.

I cannot recommend this game, nobody should buy this at $70. $47 felt like a scam. Maybe $20. Maybe try about three hours of it and refund it immediately.

I got Starfield on sale and only play it using Geforce Now + my phone since it already feels like a mobile game. I'm playing it before bed, and it's an amazing sleep aid.

So, I kicked off Starfield with high hopes and, honestly, the game had me hooked right off the bat. It‚Äôs slick, it looks fantastic, and the gun fights? They're pretty sweet. But man, when you try to swing a sword or something, it feels like you're wading through mud. It's rough.

**Shooting Stars and Clunky Swords**

Ranged combat is where it's at in Starfield. You get into these firefights, and it‚Äôs a blast - feeling right on the money. But then you try to get up close and personal, and it just falls flat. It's like, why even bother with melee when it feels like you're trying to fight with pool noodles?

**Wandering the Cosmos: Big, But Kinda Empty**

The exploration part starts off super promising. You're jumping from planet to planet thinking, ""This is it. This is the adventure."" But after a while, it hits you: most of these places feel empty. It's like going on a road trip only to find out all your destinations are just empty parking lots. And the space travel? Cool at first, but it quickly turns into just hitting the fast-forward button.

**Fighting and Questing: Could Use Some Spice**

Going back to the combat, it's just not as fun as what we've seen in other Bethesda games. Fallout 4's battles felt more alive, more dynamic. And the whole decision-making and RPG elements? Not really feeling it here. It's like the game wants to be this epic space RPG, but then forgets to invite the RPG to the party.

Remember how in Skyrim, you'd stumble upon a side quest that could easily outshine the main story? Yeah, doesn't really happen here. And the companions... it's like they went to the NPC factory and hit ""copy-paste"" except for the one robot dude who‚Äôs somewhat interesting. Melee combat? Let's not even go there. Swinging a legendary weapon shouldn't feel like you're trying to hit someone with a piece of spaghetti.

**Final Verdict: Maybe Wait for a Sale**

After a solid 70 hours, my take is: it's not the worst way to spend your time, but it's also not the space epic I was hoping for. It's got its moments, but they're floating in a sea of ""meh."" If you're curious, maybe wait till it's on a deep sale or when they release a Game of the Year edition that's packed with extras and fixes.

So, that's my two cents on Starfield. It's a journey with some highs but a lot of just coasting through the galaxy on autopilot."

I just don‚Äôt understand all the negative reviews. I love this game. 
Is it as good as Skyrim or Fallout? Probably not. But is it a solid RPG game set in space with all the same traits of a Bethesda game? Yes.

Why I love this game:
‚ñ∫ I have my own spaceship and crew, and I can visit hundreds of planets and moons to explore and gather resources. The open-world freedom is incredible.
‚ñ∫ I get to visit places seemingly inspired by Star Trek, Blade Runner, Firefly, Star Wars, Total Recall, Aliens, and more
‚ñ∫ I can go on diplomatic missions, military ones, stealth ones, spy ones, or just waste two hours exploring a random moon gathering resources, and scanning fauna and flora. I mean, you can spend days hopping around a random planet finding abandoned mining stations and dark caves and resources
‚ñ∫ I can build outposts on distant worlds or decorate my penthouse suites on various planets using all the materials I have gathered and looted
‚ñ∫ I get to have space battles with pirates, choose to destroy ships or board them and steal them, get to modify ships or just sell them. I can also have firefights with the bad guys on planets, space stations, and ships.
‚ñ∫Join factions and allegiances, build reputation, or betray them and suffer the bounty on my head
‚ñ∫The RPG leveling and special powers are just as good as they were in Skyrim and other Bethesda titles
‚ñ∫I have dozens of side missions and quests when I don‚Äôt want to focus on the interesting main story. 
‚ñ∫The settings are beautiful, the starships are gorgeous, and the graphics and ambient sound are wonderful.

Yes, I get some of the criticisms. A lot of the planets and moons and structures are redundant and a little 
boring. (That‚Äôs what exploring is.If you love just exploring, you will love this game). Some of the characters lack depth.Many of the decisions seem to lack consequences; there is not a lot of free will. Other criticisms seem comical: ‚ÄúThe main city isn‚Äôt that big‚Äù for example. But overall this is a great addition to the Bethesda universe, and this sci-fi nerd is loving it.

It just doesn't have the same magic as Bethesda's previous games like Oblivion, Skyrim or Fallout 3/4. It much harder to get lost exploring the world because of how barren most planets are, and how few and far between the interesting areas in the game are. You won't have the same experience wandering around and coming across a fun adventure like in their past games, and I think it's entirely because the playable game world is cut up into hundreds of chunks.

As a side note, I did not enjoy the ship combat at all. It feels very clunky and under-baked.

I hope that some form of DLC will bring something fun for me to this game, because I barely touched the main quest and only dipped my toes into the cowboy faction (I forget their name) quest before I just stopped playing due to boredom and frustration. But I'm under the impression that my particular issues with the game are embedded in it's DNA, and this game just isn't salvageable for me unless they re-designed it from the ground up. But we all know that can't happen. They can only keep gluing parts on to try and improve it, which won't fix the issues in the foundation that everything is built on top of.

That being said, I do understand how some folks will be able to find fun in this game. Several of my friends keep coming back this game and have some legitimate fun, so your mileage may vary. But from someone who loved Bethesda's previous games, going back to Oblivion, this game shreds up what fun there is from exploring one focused world, or a small number of them, and sprinkles it around hundreds of different places with barely anything of note in them."

Fallout 4 suffers from all of the exact same problems as this game, in fact it's somehow worse, because the ""radiant quests"" are [b] LITERALLY THE SAME MISSION OVER AND OVER. A NEW SETTLEMENT NEEDS OUR HELP. I'LL MARK IT ON YOUR MAP. [/b]
At least Starslop lets you actually choose your characters background and history. Wow! They remembered to put RPG mechanics in their RPG! Incredible! Even though they virtually have no bearing on your story or playthrough. Instead we got ""Nate/Nora"" in Fallout Bore. And the decisions to be snarky, boyscout, pscyhopath, or leave the conversation... Lol. Every character looks like their made of playdough. And the horrific facial animations of Fallout 4 still give me nightmares.

Fallout 76 is just Fallout 4, but worse in actually every conceivable way. No story whatsoever, and they locked 80% of the gameplay behind an actual subscription fee for some of the worst ""RPG"" gaming I have ever experienced in a game. RNG For perks? Lmfaooooo.

Even Skyrim, the most lauded and beat off game in Bethesda's entire library is so heinously lacking in meaningful RPG mechanics that the vast majority of people will agree that while they enjoyed their first playthrough, they absolutely can no longer play it without ENORMOUS amount of mods... Laughable stealth mechanics that were never fixed, boring and mindless melee combat. Like 10 types of spells, and every questline tries to make you feel like a super special messiah while they gargle on your peen for the entire main questline. It also has the same reused assets for 98% of it's dungeons over and over and over and over. With the same voice actors, OVER AND OVER AND OVER. Oh boy, can't wait to join the Dark Brotherhood, that was one of the best questlines in Oblivi- Annnnnd I'm already Listener. Amazing! It took all of 2 quests!

Good things about Starfield... Uhhh.... Making your ship and....I guess Combat is alright...? But every enemy is a bullet sponge. Space combat is alright, and the zero gravity is cool. Besides that, it's just straight up the same game they've been selling for 10 years. Don't let people tell you it's ""unplayable bad"" or ""the worst Bethesda game"" that title belongs 100% to Fallout 76 IQ Points. Period.

I went into this game hopeful and for a little while it was entertaining. I enjoyed the amazing visuals and the concept of delving into a whole new type of Bethesda style adventure. But I've realized that the classic Bethesda formula doesn't work anymore. When you have games like Baldur's Gate 3, hell when you look at Fallout New Vegas which came out in 2010, you can see what decision based game play should be like. Your actions should matter; there should be consequences to siding with one faction over another. You should not be able to be friends with everybody. Where is the replay value if you can do pretty much everything in a single playthrough. If you go to help UC with their terrormorph quest-line after you helped the crimson fleet pirates destroy the UC vigilance they should tell you to piss off. I was also bothered by the fact that the lifeforms found on inhabited planets were just reskinned alternatives that you could see multiple times throughout the different planets/systems. As for the depth or feeling of the game, it comes off as very superficial and surface level. The emotion isn't really where it ought to be for a AAA game of 2023. There's this small side quest you can do where you find this audio log from a man who is saying good bye to his wife and kid because he knows he's going to die. Your job is to bring it to his wife and I have to say the voice acting just in that clip had given me hope for the emotional direction of the game. I can say it is the first time I have ever teared up while playing a Bethesda game. But that was it; that was the one little example of real emotional depth and it wasn't even a main quest. I'm not trying to trash Bethesda but something really needs to desperately change when it comes to the way they make a game. It makes me scared because Elder Scrolls 6 is in development and it's a game I've been looking forward to since Fallout 4 released. Skyrim is very beloved but it is a game that came out in 2011 and standards have changed. Cranking out another skyrim with enhanced graphics is not going to work. Bethesda is no doubt full of talented dedicated people in all of their departments but the people leading these projects (I'm talking to you Todd Howard) really need to take a page out of Larian and Obsidian's book. I hope they can put down their pride and really get to the heart of what needs to happen for Bethesda going forward. I don't know how much I can recommend this game; I guess I would have to say that I don't. Modders may fix it to a point but they really shouldn't have to."

Starfield's flaws are well documented - loading screens galore, exploration blockers and weird design/gameplay choices.

The writing is solid and often better than Skyrim, good choice and RPG elements, beginnings of  a rich world and lore. All this needs building upon by Bethesda and the community creators. I've used numerous mods to help the experience but that's always the way, and why I cam over to Steam (modding on Game Pass is a pain).

The individual systems work well and in my entire first playthrough (60 hours), I always had fun. I like the setting, the art and the general Bethesda mechanics.
Nevertheless, Starfield is dissapointing in major ways too. For one, it feels like it lacks creativity on a fundamental level. Even though there are interesting ideas and concepts and feeling of relatively clear game direction, the whole game feels very ‚Äúcorporate‚Äù, as in, it lacks a central creative force that actually wants to tell something meaningful. Everything feels a bit soulless.
Additionally, the strongest aspects of former Bethesda Game Studio games, the hand-crafted open worlds, do not exist in Starfield, due to a favour of procedural generation. I think this is just a minor flaw though, as the game wants to go another direction with it‚Äôs world space and that‚Äôs ok and works fine, but it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs strong suit either.
Lastly, a the international versions of the game suffer from horrendous lip animation asynchrony, making those versions unbearable. Previous BGS games had custom lip animations, why is that not possible here as well?

Ultimately, I think Starfield is objectively an ok to good game, but subjectively it‚Äôs dissapointing. 3/5"

Sable is a really unique survivor that stands out a lot. Can definitely see a lot of detail has gotten into her.

The killer is also nice, although feel the power is a little unfitting? Like why pink blob? Feel like crawling, shape shifting would've fit more with the promotional material, but none the less a very liked killer as well.

The map is really nice. My only negative would be that there isn't more buildings. It doesn't feel like a town per say. Another thing I dislike is how we still get the fenced up map. Understand fully the map needs to be closed, but could be a bit more creative and immersive than just a fence. Be it buildings, big rocks, ocean, cliff holes ect. It feels a little bland to know there's just a wall and behind it there's nothing but unloaded mass and void? Like half the time you can even see where the map stops right outside.

It wouldn't have performed as well if it did if it wasn't riding off the coat tails of the original Modern Warfare trilogy. 

As for Multiplayer, dear lord is it abysmal. You really have no incentive to move anywhere, because the ttk is so fast you will find yourself dropped at incredible speeds because someone is camping behind a closed door.

With a wide variety of class and skill choices, you can mix up your playstyle constantly to suit your needs and tastes with incredibly flashy moves. 

Each monster has their own strengths and weaknesses which you must exploit with your team of AI controlled, player created followers. The AI of your followers can be a bit strange and counterproductive at times, but generally if the players that created those followers fine tune their personality traits properly as well as pick sensible skills and gear, then your team will be a well oiled machine capable of taking on any challenge. If at some point you either outgrow your followers or need ones with different skills to better suit your foes, then you can easily swap them out for another and compare their stats, skills, and equipment. Upon sending away a follower, you can also give a gift to the follower's creator and leave a review on their performance for others to see.

There are many quests in this game which are either limited time events or require specific circumstances to unlock, which completely leverages the use of the New Game+ mode after completing the main campaign. For those who seek a more brutal challenge, there is the Bitterblack Isle mega dungeon which was added in the Dark Arisen expansion. This place is truly terrifying, and the feel of it can only be described as something in between a Dungeons and Dragons and Dark Souls dungeon crawl scenario. Enemies are vicious, and often inflict debilitating effects on your party, with overwhelming bosses that will appear from time to time at often the worst of times. As you progress through the hauntingly beautiful, and horrifyingly oppressing floors of the dungeon, it will only get progressively harder with new or empowered enemy types that are tailor made to make you suffer. If you go to Bitterblack Isle, prepare for success, and prepare to die.

With an incredible depth of monsters, strategy, amazing magic, and more, Dragon's Dogma is an unsung masterpiece in the genre."

76561198029584875,1928980,False,0.76118624210357666,"[b]This is an early access review.[/b]

Nightengale is not a bad game. Currently, I find the game mildly enjoyable, and I want this to be only a [i]slightly[/i] negative review. But in its current early access state, I cannot recommend it. The ideas are great. The mechanics are clunky.

The game has a solid Victorian-Gaslamp-Fae aesthetic. From your home base, you conjure up small, procedurally-generated maps with the biome and difficulty type you specify. You can further modify these realms or your home realm with a single set of modifiers. These modifier, biome and difficulty options come in the form of ""cards"" you unlock. Quests and a desire for gaining better equipment or more options drives you to explore ever more dangerous realms, all theoretically in a quest to reach the fabled Nightingale city after a disaster obliterated stable fae-realm transportation.

All of that is very good. The developers nail the aesthetic. But the elements beyond that feel shallow or clunky.

There are famous figures from history and mythology, like Doctor Frankenstein, to meet and get basic fetch quests from. These characters are not voice acted; their models are barely more then mannequins. And they won't offer more than a paint-coat thin level of lore. Your titular guide, Puck, is a far more interesting character, delightfully voice-acted, and with obfuscated intentions. Puck is intriguing. So far as I have played, he is the only one.

I have played for a considerable number of hours and have not reached the end of the current content. At the same time, I somewhat feel like I did long ago. There are three distinct biomes which the difficulty cards modify with largely cosmetic changes. I thrilled at seeing airships in the sky for the first time, or industrial towers, until I realized they were just stage dressing with no baring on gameplay. I'm still looking for the same landmarks, still completing the same three-note musical puzzles, still fighting many of the same enemy types. As difficulty increases, I will occasionally slightly more complex musical puzzles, or a new monster to pickaxe to death. But these changes are too incremental.

The building is clunky but serviceable. After playing games with glorious building systems like [i]Valheim[/i] and [i]Enshrouded[/i], it feels like a step backwards. The same goes for crafting. I craft what I can with what I have, but feel no drive to push up a technology ladder. There's no dangling carrot. Neither building nor crafting are [i]bad[/i], but they fail to inspire.

A few survival elements are beyond superb. The penalties for over-encumbrance in [i]Nightingale[/i] scale. And you are always able to teleport back to your base regardless of encumbrance. This a [b]phenominal[/b] bit of game design! Yet other survival elements are mediocre at best. The hunger rate in the game is obnoxious. Nobody needs to eat that many animals worth of meat a day to avoid starvation. Hunger does not work that way.

The largest problem, however, is that [i]Nightingale[/i] is plagued with poor mechanical choices, tragic complexity, and one of the worst documentation systems I have encountered.

Inventory can be a nightmare. Things only stack with things that are exactly like it, and minor variations abound. You will find your storage containers clogged with single-digit stacks of small variations of the same item. Even the same meat from the same type of animal killed in a different realm or under different conditions might craft with a post-decimal difference in one stat, making it require its own slot in your backpack. This problem extends into crafting, where you cannot craft an item that requires two pieces of leather if your two pieces come from different animals. To an extent understandable as some items gain bonuses based on which animal's hide went into its crafting. But most don't, and this issue applies unilaterally.

Your crafting tables receive bonuses by building augmentations nearby and/or putting them in suitable positions. This is a wonderful idea implemented exceptionally well in [i]Valheim[/i] and echoed in many other games. [i]Nightingale[/i] takes it a step farther by having these augmentations also give extra plans. However,  crafting tables only accept limited augmentations and you cannot chose which ones they are drawing upon. Plus many of the benefits listed for augmentations are locked until unclear conditions are met. 

The answers to these and many other questions might be found in the byzantine labyrinth of in-game documentation, but just as likely doesn't exist outside asking people on reddit. In some cases, different information about the same game element are available on different menus with no explanation. Some information is obfuscated unnecessarily. For example, when sorting by weight, you lose the ability to see how many items are in a stack. At the same time, the game has features that would be very welcome if it was clear they existed. I am by far not the first player to rack up multiple digits of play hours before learning you can break down higher tier essence for the lower tier needed for item repairs. 

To exacerbate matters, there is a lack of complexity where it is sometimes needed. For example, one quest requires you to betray a trust in order acquire further vital quests. That is not fun, especially since you feel railroaded into it. There should be another option. Similarly, building in general needs a lot more room to be creative. 

I could list other examples, but the point is already clear: the developers need to give many systems another pass, tightening them up with a focus on fun over tedium and a wariness for non-beneficial complexity. They need to completely overhaul the in-game documentation.

I believe this game has a lot of potential. I find the [i]idea[/i] of it fun. I find the aesthetics of it delightful. But right now it has too many problems to be more than mildly enjoyable. I look forward to the day when it becomes so, and I hope to change this review at that time."

76561198279709307,1928980,True,0.523809552192687988,"The game is definitely not a game that can be understood or progressed in 10-15 hours. I loved the game's crafting and building system. For example, to produce a rifle, you need to produce materials in three or four different stations. Of course, in order to produce these materials, you need to collect different resources beforehand. And with these materials you can produce the rifle. Honestly, I really liked this detailed production phase. For Building, you need to learn recipes and you find or buy these recipes in different realms. The building models are very detailed and nice. I hope the crafting and building system will not be changed.

Let's talk about the realm system... You travel to different realms with the combination of biome and major cards and you do this through portals. With minor cards, you can change the properties of the realm you are in (such as production advantages, strength bonus, food consumption) and when you do this, the environmental conditions (such as colors, weather conditions) also change. In short, you create alternate realms in the game through portals.

All this process of traveling, crafting and building between realms serves a purpose. You are trying to find Nightingale City, which is very important for humanity. You try to do this by constantly following quests, rumors and glimmers of hope.

In short, I loved the game. This is the best survival, building, crafting game I have ever played. Even though it's still in early access, I think it's doing a great job."

76561198076558737,1928980,True,0.523809552192687988,"There are a number of good and bad things in this game, but overall, I really enjoyed playing it through. It took me about 280 hours to complete everything defeat all bosses, including open world bosses, and get all achievements. 

I took my time with the game because the world was a consistent creation, I enjoyed adding new things to build with, and getting through the ""ladder"" of realms until I reached the very last ones. 

The difficulty is not bad, but varies. overall game play can be customised between ""wuss"" and ""not bad"". I played mostly on hard, with the last few ascended realms pushed up to Extreme. Extreme difficulty turned out to be the proper one for me. it was challenging enough. The only place I saw the balance broken was in the Solo vaults where I was dying and chipping away on a boss 1 bullet at a time, it took me 2+ hours to get through a solo vault. the public ones are set to easy I think, because with other players, it's laughably easy, 

Another point that I didn't like were the entirety of the vault system. It was the same as the realm vaults just 3 times longer I understand the system but found it really really boring. You are basically either piss blood in solo vaults, or breeze through them in a group without the need to shoot a single shot.. 

I really liked the skyboxes, I wish the game would have more variety in that regard. 

The building was a bit awkward at first, but it worked. The only thing bad about it was that the pacing in which the building pieces were distributed across the realms was way off.. I expected a new building set after my 2nd portal but I had to wait waaaaaay longer, to the point that I was borderline bored with the game.. I liked building and make an interesting house that I upgrade over time, so the lack of building pieces was frustrating. The devs confirmed to be working on the ""replace"" function for the building elements so I'm not giving them flack for it.

One system I found greatly confusing was the crafting one. I see that it's robust, but it's very convoluted. You need to unlock the station, the augment and the recipe separately.. Why? Why can't the augments just unlock the recipe?This needs to be 1 step shorter or better organised since this was one of the things I was considering giving the game a not recommended for, even though it's a brilliant system. In my opinion, the augments should unlock the new recipes. There are 2 ways to go at it. 1: the augments are cosmetic only, they are the ""decoration"" category, and you unlock stations and recipes from the realms. The other, perhaps better version is when you build an augment, they give the ""exrta"" recipes, and the workstation can build any item you unlocked without augments. 
The problem is the workstation / augment attachments. one augment can enhance more than 1 station, and 1 station can get limited augments in range This leads to me loose track of what workstation is effected by what augment, and missing out of recipes, because there are no more augment slots on the station. Then I look up what is needed and I see that workstation and augments are next to each other yet I still cannot build something. I have to offload the table for example, them move it to an empty area, then move that specific augment in range to unlock crafting of what I need, then put everything back after done.. This is tedious and confusing.

I want to mention a thing I really liked, but was probably not intended: Hunting for companions. I really liked the idea that there can be randomly named people out there that you can recruit (although a bit awkwardly). A significant portion of my gametime was devoted to always looking at the NPC PIOs in a realms to see if I can find one that looked better or called better. Most of the NPCs were ugly a bit, and I knew I wanted a female companion. It didn't help that my companions kept disappearing between travels with all the high level gear I gave to them.. But regardless, it was a good minigame to find one that I liked. I eventually settled on one that was called Alice and looked like the youtuber ShoeOnHead. A bit.

Getting NPCs in realms was interesting, and good idea but some parts are very bad. For example, 50%of the time, you need to help them build something before you can recruit them. WHY? Now we built a house halfway in water  with crafting stations, that nobody will use, because I took the NPC,, I think they should have a way to offer 2 things when you approach an NPC builder site: a quest to protect them while they pack and a quest to help them build, if you don't want to recruit them. That way you can decide based on name and look if you want to take them or help them settle. Much better system.

Multiplayer was more or less working, but it was a bit awkward to experiment with what was their loot and what was mine, what we could loot both and what we couldn't. It shouldn't have to be an experiment.. 

Building limits are assss.. Especially if you want to build on the same realm.. The reason me and my friends were not building on the same realm was that we all wanted our own house but kept hitting the build limit which was quite bad. 

The story of the game was quite good, and void of all agenda, which I've not expected just by looking at the gamedevs. Thinking about the game overall ,the largest contributor for why I recommend it it's because it's focusing on the game and the world, and not on agendas and quotas. It just want to tell a good an interesting story. I'm recommending it because it's a game / fun first, and not a MTS / agenda first game. 

An additional thing I wanted to mention was the voice acting. The voice actor for Pluck was extraordinary, I hope that the rest of the dialogues and notes will also be narrated with this quality in the future. I'll probably come back when new biomes will be added. That and new building pieces are the only thing that can pull be back in, since I played this game nearly for 300 hours at this point, I've seen enough, and the endgame currently is quite lacklustre 

Overall good, game, time well spent, some misfires, lots more to develop but what's already in there is worth recommendation. Plus you can have a dog in-game."

The game is a lot of fun, its well made, so why the negative review? 
Its simple really, this game has 3 limits when it comes to building, and building is one of the main draw to survival games like this.
1) 100 buildings per realm (a limit that seems ok)
2) 300 structual pieces per building (annoying but combined with the 100 buildings you can work around that)
3) 350 items per realm (thats: crafting stations, doors, lights, augments, growing plots, strage crates, etc)

You can make a functional base with that limit... but thats what it will be... functional.

Keep hoping they will up the limit, its the unreal engine and the limit is insane for that engine (even more so given how small the maps are) Then add in that 6 players can share a realm and you can see the issue.

Was told ""were looking into it"" but then patch notes come out...sorting inventory is coming, offline is coming, craft from storage is coming, nice things to have sure...but what about the limit? 

Latest devblog mentions structual limit being looked at...thats not the issue its the item limit that is. I do not understand it.
Ark has 60 players and huge maps, there is a limit but youll never reach it.
Connan, 30 player can be more, same as above.
Satisfactory, 4 players, massive maps and their would be riots if they had 350 item limit.
All the same engine (in the case of ark and satisfactory the same version of the engine) 

Yet I have had people in Nightingale discord ""limits fine for me"" or ""its not the engine thats the issue its to protect the servers""... The former, well good for them, the latter is insanity to anyone who has developed with the unreal engine. 

In short, if you like to make huge bases with your mates that have content in them, decorated, built to produce items at good speeds etc.... then know that the trailers for this mislead you. DONT GET IT.

Nightingale shows a lot of potential but in its current state it's quite dull.
The cons
Building:
- No wedge blocks.
- Only purpose for a base is crafting and storage.
- Very limited options on building blocks leads to less creative and fun bases.
- The augmentation system is very anti QoL.
Exploration:
- Bit slow, some PoI's are well.. not interesting.
- Very repetitive locations
- Card system is cool but could be much better if it changed more than just the look of the realm and some minor things.
Combat:
- I found combat to be very very boring. Had to play it in a harder difficulty for it to feel a little challenging.
- Repetitive enemies and combat styles.
The pros
I honestly didn't think Nightingale introduces anything that stirs excitement for me. A good games makes you wish you were done with work and at home ready to play and see what may happen. This game felt more like a chore. The card system is interesting but it's essentially a buff with few positives and some negatives. The augmentation system is tedious but has potential, essentially unlocking new recipes while allowing you to sort of decorate your base with objects that have some purpose. 
The one thing I really thought was cool was character creation. But sadly for me it was pretty much downhill from there."

Essentially I know long time fans love Medieval 2, Rome and Napoleon and I haven't spend much time in those titles at all so this is coming from a ''Newer player'' of the series if you will. In short my enjoyment from this game is only compared to Warhammer 2 since it's the one I've played the most and Three Kingdoms in my humble opinion is a way better game and a great entry title for anyone looking to play Total War.


I got this around two weeks ago for around $40ish in a sale and it has become my favorite Total War. The battles are great with soldiers carrying banners(which adds to the immersion) and the engagement itself being extremely cinematic whether you have a volley of arrows taking down charging infantry, cavalry clashing against enemy lines and the map itself is just gorgeous to look at. It also gets rid of the annoying ""agents"" and replaces them with ""spies"", which are characters from your court that can essential sabotage another warlord's effort but the mechanic and court itself does leave something to be desired but I'll take this any day over having to control a swarm of agents around the map. Overall this entry is enjoyable with the different playable factions having just enough flair and gameplay mechanics that makes the game feel fresh after hours of playing a specific faction. If, like many people online say, you didn't give this game a chance for a lack of knowledge/interest in Chinese history, do yourself a favor and give Three Kingdoms a chance, show CA how wrong they were in cutting support for this game.


*Additional Comments*

I played a campaign in vanilla, another with Radious Mod and a third with TROM. Out of the three I would highly suggest using Radious with 80% more upkeep to have a more polish experience that is basically bug free, adds new units to the roster and with the latter, prevents the ai and player from spamming massive doom stacks.

To avoid having a ten page essay here I would like to quickly add that the unit management here is done masterfully. Instead of having a general/hero and 19 units spread out in a tab that makes everything look meh imo, having different general classes(Vanguard for shock cavalry, Champion for spear infantry and Strategist for projectiles and artillery) manage six units each is a much better way of handling army composition as each class shares and has unique units to recruit.

The soundtrack, ambient and presentation are a 10/10."
76561198088946075,779340,True,0.565217375755310059,"Cons: As a huge fan of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms franchise and era, it's a little hard for me to swallow that I'm limited to one scenario (year setting) while the rest is locked behind DLC, including other lords/civilizations. It basically feels like I bought the game for full price but only received 25% of the game. In this regard, the DLC content is nothing like DLC content and is more of a paywall. Personally speaking, I feel like a strong DLC would have been when the Sima family comes into power, beginning the Jin Dynasty and putting an end to the Three Kingdoms era, or like how in Shogun 2, the DLC could have taken place in a different era, such as the Spring and Autumn Period or Warring States eras. In terms of gameplay, the UI for the overworld is honestly more confusing than it is helpful. There's important information that isn't easily accessible, such as peace treaty duration.

I enjoyed playing this game on Battle.Net before it arrived onto Steam and once it went onto Steam, I picked it up on sale and enjoyed it all over again. Until one day, after a GeForce driver update, my name was mysteriously found inappropriate upon booting up the game. So I changed it and moved on with the game again and would jump back and forth between this and the then-other popular CoD game, MWII. After another GPU driver update, my name was once again found inappropriate, preventing me from playing the game. Funny thing was, no other CoD game issued me this error, it was solely Cold War that was throwing a fit. And now I genuinely don't know what to do. I've tried installing the game on another computer and it still gives me the error, I've looked for help on forums and other places only to get nothing and find that others have encountered the same problem, I've even bought the latest CoD (MWIII) and once again, no issues with my name in that game, only with Cold War. My only choice left is to go back to the Battle.Net version that I own, but that launcher is so broken that the installation got corrupted and the new installer won't let me go past the ""continue"" option.
I am still looking for a solution to this problem and maybe then I will change my outlook/review on all of this, but until then, I say screw Activision for wasting my time and patience on what shouldn't even be an issue in the first place. Buyers beware!"

Days Gone drops you into a beautifully harsh, post-pandemic Oregon. You play as Deacon St. John, a biker outlaw struggling to live by his own code in a world gone mad. While the story may stumble into predictable territory at times, Days Gone still throws enough twists and mysteries your way to keep you invested.

Deacon's a [b] likable [/b] roughneck, but he's not alone. The supporting cast is full of memorable characters, from his gruff but loyal friend Boozer to the survivors struggling to rebuild society. You'll find yourself invested in their stories and rooting for them to survive the Freaker hordes.
The gameplay is its greatest strength. The open-world is packed with hordes of the infected 'Freakers', creating frantic, thrilling encounters. Upgrading your bike and skills creates a satisfying sense of becoming more powerful, but be warned: the early game can feel a bit slow.

[b] There are downsides. [/b] While the open world is vast and beautiful, scouring every corner for secrets will feel unrewarding. Exploration should only be done for Nero checkpoints, ambush camps, hordes and resources like ammunition, health items, crafting materials, you will not find any secret weapon or item by exploring, technical glitches can pop up. Some characters and parts of the map feel a bit underused.

[b] Should you buy it? [/b]
If you crave open-world action with a dash of survival and are ready for a few imperfections, Days Gone is worth the ride. The intense Freaker encounters, a surprisingly touching story, and rock-solid gameplay will keep you gripped until the emotional finale. While begging for a sequel, Days Gone is a memorable experience all on its own.

[b] Additional Notes [/b]
‚Ä¢	Runs well on Steam Deck
‚Ä¢	Ultrawide monitor support. (tested 21:9 3440x1440)
‚Ä¢	good optimization stable 90 + fps on UWQHD max graphics RTX 3070 i7-13700k  (apart from one cave battle which was 
        kinda stuttery)
‚Ä¢	Challenging bonus modes offer extended playtime and a welcome change of pace. They can be a bit less serious at times, 
        adding to the game's charm. However, I recommend tackling the story first to get the full impact. Although the patches that 
        can be earned in this mode give you a permanent buff to the story play-trough.

76561198085352614,529340,False,0.549672484397888184,"Victoria 3: Faustian Bargains.

I have a rule with games, especially ones locked under the divine tutelage of Paradox Interactive. ""Give it half a year and then bite"". Nothing personal to popular games, I've just learned after the last decade of bad initial releases. Half a year gives a game time to burn through the initial shilling, fix some of the issues and ideally be in a functional state. Vic 3 was the same thing. I saw it on release, saw the videos on it and was hesitant, and so I decided to bide my time. Wait for it to go as cheap as possible and then see how it operates. Got lucky and managed to get it for a whole 15 bucks and man.

I hate how I like it and I hate the issues WITH it as well.

Victoria 3's root problem is the fact it's a perfect sequel on paper. This game knows the root issues that made people love and hate Victoria 2. Everyone loved industry and the economy system, while hating warfare and the AI. So it made overall improvements to everything and is now rife with what I will only describe as ""Paradox Bargaining"" as a result. Every single marked part of this game is an improvement on the original, and to an extent that it ends up neutering the game in some aspects. Your economy management is now upgraded with the ability to micro each industry's upgrades, and the improved tech system that allows you to just pre-plan out what tech you research is SO nice. It beats the constant red light/green light of Vic 2 or HoI's tech system, and it means no more searching for each port you need to upgrade. You have one menu. It's then kneecapped by the market system, which keeps certain nations tied to their own markets. On one hand, no more flooding the markets and causing an international stock market crash, but you also will now have to deal with the fact you can't really economically cause problems. 

The Army system makes sense on paper, no more accidentally nuking your economy with 934 dragoons nor having to micro every soldier. You have a front lines mechanic and the ability to just set a point and watch your men commit crimes against humanity prior to the Geneva Convention existing. Which is fine. The issue is the barracks system, tying individual armies to barracks you have to build. Sure it means you have to make sure you can afford an army, but it doesn't stop the AI from farting out 9 gorillion conscripts suddenly. Let alone the random modifiers that make naval invasions a gamble half of the time. Speaking of which.

I whinged about Victoria 2's AI, calling it a trigger happy monster that didn't know how to manage itself while also barreling across the map causing problems. Clearly they knew that as well, but they overcooked it. Vic 3's AI is a dumbed down menace to fun, somehow barely managing their nations and yet still at the last second clinching any power play you try to make. It's been an absolute delight to watch in some aspects, seeing France go through Napoleon's and Louis's like a revolving door of monarchs but it's a constant problem in the game. Things just do not happen without you either kickstarting it or in some way inducing it. I've seen America's still not annexing Texas by 1890 or the Qing still being alive and not filled with opium. I think we can ratchet it up at least a smidge, although knowing Paradox, they'll overcook THAT as well.

And no I will not be mentioning the DLC's, I didn't buy them. It's the real reason I didn't buy in until now because I know the first few DLC's for a Paradox game are basically tinsel before they actually nut up and give us something good. Vic 3's a good framework of a game, which is classically Paradox but don't fully uninstall Vic 2 yet. This game still has a lot of flab that they're going to iron out over time, the question being how much of that ironing out is going to have a price tag attached to it? Time will tell. Until then, I'm going back to beating up Paraguay."

You have to admit that this game will forever stand the test of time in its genre and the industry as a whole, especially when it comes to the quality, when not only is the game visually remarkable, fantastically playable, superbly written, completely alive, but you can actually venture off into the many planes of the Egyptian afterlife.

To be perfectly honest to you all, my favourite game world I have ever experienced has to be the location of Aaru, the Field of Reeds. It is a heavenly paradise considered to be the ultimate destination of the soul. Aaru is a setting of an endless, beautiful field of long grass, shining like gold under a magical skybox of the warm desert sun. Great ships float across the fields as though it were an ocean. I could go on, describing the beauty of a long forgotten history that this masterpiece simulates within the game.

The breathtaking historical setting and landscapes are the game's strongest asset. The times where I was exploring in a carefree manner, without any specific goal were the most enjoyable.

However, beneath the surface level lies a bunch of underdeveloped and poorly thought out systems. I wouldn't discount the game for this reason alone, but the most egregious misstep is the narrative execution.

What begins as a seemingly promising tale of revenge and redemption soon loses its way, mostly due to the mishandling of Aya, one of the central characters. Initially introduced as a strong and capable ally to the protagonist, Aya's character development takes a nosedive halfway through the story, being suddenly transformed into a one-dimensional plot device.

After these issues became apparent, I still forced myself to complete the game mostly because I wanted to see how it would end. My journey through ancient Egypt ultimately culminated not in a triumphant flourish, but with a whimper of resignation. I was glad to be done with it.

Unfortunately, in the end, this game stands out as unfulfilled potential. While the allure of exploring one of history's most fascinating eras initially captivated me, it became impossible to overlook the poorly crafted narrative, as it completely undermines the overall experience.

If you're a fan of open world games or this particular historical setting, there may be something for you here, but my journey through ancient Egypt was nothing more than a climb up the pyramid of disappointment."

I have the presets on HIGH. Not on VERY HIGH or even ULTRA. No. On HIGH! With a freakin 4070! Single digit frames!

It's the same old formula: big map, lots of pointless activities. This time you actually HAVE to do SOME of them if you want to continue the main story, because now you have arbitrary levels. But it would all be fine if the side quests and all the other stuff weren't just copy pasted points of interests and a mix of ""fetch this, kill that, save him"" and most importantly, beyond all, waste your time.

No more Ubisoft games for me. No more falling for the hype, I won't give a single dollar anymore to this company, not even if they sell their games for $1. I mean it."

the Good: Controls like Butter, Sound design is amazing, Graphics are beautiful, especially with Reshade, Gameplay is fun

The Bad: The one biggest issue with this game, is the Quests, the Mainline Quests are fine, its all the Side quests that are the issue. They are only filler quests..

By filler quests, I mean they are all the same thing with the same objective... you eather have to carry someone to safety, Assassinate someone or something, or Escort missions.

Those are literally the ONLY 3 objectives every side quest in the game is, so far anyway 21 hours in, it is EXTREMELY repetitive, the mainline quests are fine, they throw in some different objectives,but they are also guilty with following this pattern, just not as much as the side quests, they just feel like copy and paste quests with altered short stories with them.

The mainline quests level requirements are far apart, 1 quests would require you to be level 20, when the next one will require you to be level 28, and you cannot complete a quest if you are 3+ levels behind, so you are FORCED to play the repetitive Side Quests to level up to continue with the main story.

Its like it was made to make enemies that are 3+ levels above you to be impossible to kill, and are a 1 shot to you.

I personally would rather the game be shorter, and have only main quests, or just a few side quests, rather than 70% of the game being the same 3 objectives.

The game is fun, looks good and runs extremely smooth, just the horrible side quests which are the issue. I recommend giving it a go, just expect to be bored with all the repetitive side quests."

The graphics were good, and the use of the bow was very fun - but the new weapons system really threw me off, and made the game thoroughly unenjoyable. Otherwise, the story was a great experience, and you have the regular Ubisoft high points, fetch quests, and collectables that are necessary for an AC."

Story :
Great story with amazing surroundings. Make sure you take your time to look around the map for scenic beauties. Some of the spot resembles actual places in egypt which are beautifully made. You spend a lot of your time roaming around in the desert initially, so better enjoy the scene. Also try to explore and visit different places in the map to enjoy the game rather than only doing the main missions and finish it. The game shows a bit of their tradition and culture inside the game which is great. I have seen many saying this not an assassins creed game and stuff, but honestly it does'nt matter, cause the story graphics, scenery etc makes it worth your while.

Game is really great. Its really worth your money and long enough story to keep you hooked in. Your money will be well spent. Now many will say its an offline game and crack is available, so why buy this game. My answer will be firstly for a safe download + you get back to the game whenever you want. If you are a fan of this series, its worth it, just pick it up on a sale and your wallet will be happy :D"

76561197994033900,582160,True,0.523809552192687988,"While I don't love this one quite as much as Odyssey, it's my second favorite in the franchise. (Valhalla would be third.) To be fair, I don't play the games for the AC mythos so much as for the feel of being in ancient Egypt, Greece, or what-have-you. 

In that regard, this game is fantastic. I've seen Egyptologists reviewing it, and it's hands-down the best simulation of Ptolemy Era Egypt around. The game is likewise terrific, though I'm not a fan of You-killed-my-<insert person here>-and-now-I-seek-vengeance plots. They're pretty over done and tedious.  Despite that, being a killing machine who can climb anything and leap off buildings (and survive) is always fun. And the way Bayek's personal vengeance plot is woven into historical events around Julius Caesar and Cleopatra is entertaining. 

Don't take the game's interpretation of these characters to heart, though. Both were far more intelligent than portrayed. And despite Cleopatra's political machinations, getting herself impregnated by both Caesar and Marcus Antonius‚Äîthough not at the same time‚Äîshe was motivated by a love of her country and her children. She comes across a bit shrewish here. 

When you finish the game, you get the option to start a new game with your character's current stats, armor, weapons, etc. Most of the guards and phylakes (bounty hunters) you come across are at your level now, so it's not a cakewalk, but you don't have to spend forever getting your best stuff back. It's a great option."

The visual is dazzling to say the least. The gameplay is invariably refined! I love the fact that the game has vast content without confusing the player. The RPG element is easy to grasp and not intimidating the player with seemingly limitless options (unlike some other games). 

This game needs more love and stands on its own. Spent hours gazing at the wonder of ancient Egypt that Ubisoft had painstakingly put lots of detail in it. There is no need to compare this game to older Assassins Creed series, at all!"

The RPG elements inject fresh blood into the series, making Bayek's journey entertaining. However, the game takes 'historical fiction' to a whole new level with gods popping up like unexpected party crashers (just under name of animus glitch or something). The map size? Let's just say it's perfect for those looking to practice their marathon skills. As for the other characters, Cleopatra and Caesar deserved better treatment than mere afterthoughts in a mediocre lineup.

76561199007389205,582160,True,0.5,"Wow.
 After the pointlessness that was Rogue, the ""neket iadet"" that was Unity and the mediocrity that was Syndicate, we finally get this, which is, in terms of an Assassin's creed game, the closest thing we could get to a masterpiece. Now, don't get me wrong, this game still carries a lot of faults including the new combat system, which despite offering a refreshing approach of freedom can be infuriatingly inconsistent at times (I advise anyone to begin this game on the easy setting to start with. You can change the difficulty at any point you feel you need more of a challenge from the combat) but this game gave me everything I ever realistically expected as an AC fan and the game delivers so much choice and option to tailor your preferred experience of it.

The series is finally given the overhaul it desperately needed and this flourishes all the better for it and it's difficult to pick an aspect of it that fails to entertain. I've loved every minute of it. I'm a little biased with the setting, I admit, due to my love for ancient Egypt but it felt a perfect location to kick start the creed and in many ways I see this game as a reimagining or even a reboot of the series as much as a prequel. It's root influence is Black Flag providing plenty of stalking zones for stealth. Chuck in some HZD, a pinch of the Witcher and an overall feel of the original Tomb Raider (In my personal top 5 of all time) and you essentially have the components that make this game what it is.

Bayek, the lead character, is briliantly portrayed and a massive improvement on the cardboard cutouts from previous installments and his altruism propels you through a gargantuan story which is nothing short of epic in scope charting the power struggle in Egypt for thier independance from Romans, Greeks and thier own Phaorohs. The more I played, the more I liked and the further up the AC ladder it got. In fact, I think I have a new favourite. Thank you, Ubisoft (Never thought i'd say that...)"

The game was fun, the systems were great, substantial updates came frequently and communication from Lava was abundant. The original reason I even started following his work was because of his monetization practices in his previous game, Idle Skilling, and at the beginning, that practice followed into this game.

You could, at one point, achieve everything in the game without ever spending a cent, gems were drip-fed but plentiful enough that the items in the premium shop never seemed out of reach. 2023 changed that. With the addition of capes that have continued to power creep the game, account features like auto loot and companion pets all locked behind a hard paywall, and a gacha system put in place in world 4.

Additionally, substantial content updates slowed to a crawl, to the point where 2023 saw no new worlds at all. The updates we did get were either horribly timegated or progression was stalled by RNG (Currently, my equinox is completely stalled because my upgrade paths are RNG based, so it's a roll of the dice.)

It's a shame because this game used to be fun, but ever since World 4 released, the writing has been on the wall, the game has been in a steep decline, and I cannot recommend anyone who hasn't already sunk time into it to start now."

Game is a fun auto clicker but when talked to dev he was very uncaring of his community. Seems like he only cares about the people who give him money and not the casual to f2p community. Sad to see when the game has so much potential. I considered coming back to game when character deletion is added, but when talked to dev he was just very insensitive and narcissistic."

Yes the game got a  Cash Shop though the premium currency is given out to you over time in different ways and events, so over time you can simply just save up over time, so you be the judge yourself on how much you wish to spend, pay for 'convenience' so to speak, or go full whale.
I highly recommend you join a guild because the passive bonuses to your account and weekly gifts which also rewards premium currency adds another trickle for overall gains.

However, I have learned the hard way that YOU MUST PLAN YOUR CHARACTERS CLASSES!!! If you simply spam a single class or just don't plan, you might get screwed and have no way of undoing it.

-Game description used to say this was a ""game for gamers and would never stoop down to scummy practices"" or something like that..well... Until he added Gacha and erased that from game description suddenly.. I believe I heard he couldn't release to apple store until he added pity system... So basically forced to do it.. Says a lot about the dev tbh..

- Dev banned anyone in discord who had an issue with Gacha system and slipped behind the shadows, meanwhile his simp army gaslight and shit on anyone else remaining..

- This discord is an echo chamber of simps showing off their receipts of how much they spend per month like some sort of virtue signal?($1000's).. This is relevant because it shows who he surrounds himself with and the possible trajectory of the games future.

-Nerfed F2p way of making premium currency as a way to ""combat cheaters""... Well let me just say cheaters only need 5 seconds to INPUT 99999999 to get their currency... No, cheaters DON'T grind... This was targeted towards f2p to pressure them to buy gem packs.. Again when ppl in his discord spoke up, and Dev logged off again to slip away while his army shit on f2p for not spending enough money on the game, again showing off the 1000's they spend.... Starting to see a pattern here?

-So Dev attracts f2p to start a base for his game, whales are attracted to games with big number players... whales whale.. Then Dev starts hard focus to make f2p more inconvenient.. Whales say we don't need f2p in our game ""Get lost losers""..
game loses large amount of F2p.. Whales don't want to whale game with low player count.. Game dead.. 

Anyway.. Be grateful you missed the honeymoon period.. Sunk cost fallacy plays hard here for me because I did spend a little, but I must be considered f2p still since I'm not paying his full rent/bills.. I'm just gonna let this game fade into the void for me, but yea I say avoid this game, Find a game where the Dev respects players time and money"

The game doesn't really lead you on a way to progress, almost all the quests doesn't give clues on what to do or where to do it. Same for the equip and the achievements, so you waste time doing always the same things without seeing an improvement in your character.
The ""group events"" are so trash, first of all it's quite hard to find a group and when you found one the half is afk.. The mobs inside are way too strong for low lvl players (and i mean also who's at lvl 50+) so at the end of the event your gain is a couple of things not even closer enough to improve your stats, even after 4 runs.
I think the game has some potential, but need to be cared more. Add info for everything, lead the players on how to get things even if hard, but at least they'll have a way to follow.."

Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Idleon has consistently captivated players with its unique blend of idle gameplay, intricate mechanics, and charming pixel art style. The recent update to World 6 has elevated this already stellar game to new heights, leaving me utterly impressed and thoroughly entertained.

First and foremost, let's talk about the pixel art. The visuals in Idleon have always been a standout feature, but World 6 takes it to a whole new level. The attention to detail in every character, monster, and environment is simply breathtaking. Lava, the brilliant mind behind the development, has truly outdone themselves in creating a world that feels alive and vibrant. The pixel art not only adds to the nostalgia of classic RPGs but also brings a unique and refreshing aesthetic to the game.

One of the most commendable aspects of the game is the active involvement of Lava, the developer. It's rare to see such a strong connection between a developer and their community, but Lava's commitment to listening to player feedback and implementing improvements is truly commendable. The responsiveness to bug reports and the regular updates demonstrate a commitment to creating an optimal gaming experience for everyone.

Moreover, the community surrounding Idleon is fantastic, fostering a sense of camaraderie among players. The addition of World 6. Making it even more enjoyable to play with friends. Shoutout to the itty bitty army. 

In conclusion, Idleon's World 6 update is a testament to the exceptional talent of Lava and the dedication to delivering an outstanding gaming experience. The pixel art is a visual feast, the gameplay is engaging and dynamic, and the community involvement is exemplary. Idleon continues to raise the bar for idle games, and I eagerly await future updates to see how this masterpiece evolves. If you haven't already joined the Idleon community, now is the perfect time to dive into the enchanting world that Lava has crafted."

Another legendary game from the past. I usually rarely like game sequels, but what Metro does is exciting, each part is better than the other. And what the creators did with the third part is the most awesome thing I've ever played. Excellent game quality, excellent plot, now you are not only running underground, now you are on the other side of the subway in search of habitable lands. The fate of your comrades who cover your back already depends on you, and if you make a mistake somewhere, they will die. It feels like you're really being transported into the subway universe and experiencing it all yourself. I hope that a sequel will be released someday and the metro line will not end there.

During the game, I noticed an enormous number of bugs. Do you want to jump up in a small room? You'll get stuck in the ceiling, definitely. But it is worth praising the thoroughness of the plot and the appearance of the characters. Everything is great here. It feels like the developers put their soul into each character. Because personally, every little man felt alive and real to me.
It was very disappointing that the game has two endings (Favorable and rosy; Sad ending), but it's a pity. I expected a little more from such a game.
As a result, I noticed only bugs among the disadvantages, and it seems to me that the system requirements are too high.

Laying off the PVE team however fixed that.  So what to replace Overwatch with?

76561199011469135,2221490,False,0.560975611209869385,"I've always been iffy with Division 2. It's had a lot of potential throughout it's lifespan, and I think that is what gets me the most. It had/has a lot of chances to be something great, yet it kinda keeps getting squandered. 
The big thing about getting into build craft games is the build crafting. It's the game type, duh. But unless you want to get over the top into it, you can't do much for late game builds. Which kinda blows, I don't enjoy re-rolling a weapon or armor piece over and over because I'm missing one attribute. 
or farming a 1/3/5/7% drop chance item forever because I just need it to start the basics of my build.
They've done fun things, I think Descent and Summit are some of the most fun I've had playing Div 2. When raids first came out I was excited, but ultimately was not doing much for my team because I didn't min-max and couldn't do a lot. Descent is a rogue-lite that suffers from Divisions awkward power scaling, sometimes you'll be doing just fine for like 3 rooms then you'll get immediately 1 tapped by some random purple. It's weird. Summit is great because you can turn your brain off and focus farm gear. Just kill shit, loot shit, and go through floors. It's a god damn shame it's 100 floors though. If you don't get all pieces of that chest piece in those 100 floors, be ready to climb yet ANOTHER 100. 
They introduced armor sets, which are awesome. I like that.
WLONY was a cool expansion. Wish we got more gadgets/more interesting ones. But it was fun. 
The Manhunt stuff is kinda over grindy. I dont really like it a ton.
they've done the whole battle pass thing.
Div 2 also suffers from the ubisoft plague of horrible servers.
Anyways to prevent excess rambling, if you have 3-7 (up to 7 for raids n stuff) friends who all want to play, then get Div 2. If not, i'd recommend a hard pass. This is what i'd call a therapy/podcast game. you and all your friends hop on and talk dumb shit for hours while not using your brains. Then disband for the night when you all dont want to play it anymore but dont want to play anything else. 
6/10 because i personally like the division's concept, idea, and story. gameplay is standard."

76561199005510812,2221490,True,0.545454561710357666,Amazing graphics and storyline! Recommended!
76561197972298222,2221490,True,0.545454561710357666,"As an avid gamer, I was eagerly anticipating the release of The Division 2, and I'm pleased to say it didn't disappoint. Developed by Ubisoft Massive, this sequel builds upon the solid foundation of its predecessor, delivering an even more immersive and dynamic gameplay experience on PC.

One of the standout features of The Division 2 is its meticulously crafted open-world environment. Set in a post-pandemic Washington DC, the city feels alive and teeming with detail. From the overgrown streets to the dilapidated landmarks, every corner tells a story of a society in collapse. The level of immersion is further enhanced by the game's stunning graphics and impressive attention to detail, which truly bring the world to life.

Gameplay-wise, The Division 2 offers a diverse range of activities to keep players engaged for hours on end. Whether it's engaging in intense firefights with enemy factions, exploring hidden underground tunnels, or teaming up with friends to tackle challenging missions, there's always something new and exciting to discover. The addition of raids and strongholds also provides a satisfying endgame experience for those seeking a greater challenge.

One of the aspects that impressed me the most is the game's deep progression system. With a wide array of skills, weapons, and gear to unlock and customize, players have the freedom to tailor their playstyle to suit their preferences. Whether you prefer to be a stealthy sniper, a tanky brawler, or a support-focused healer, there's something for everyone in The Division 2.

Furthermore, the game's online component adds another layer of depth to the experience. Whether teaming up with friends or joining forces with strangers in the Dark Zone, the multiplayer aspects of The Division 2 provide endless opportunities for collaboration and competition.

That being said, The Division 2 is not without its flaws. While the game's world is undeniably vast and immersive, it can sometimes feel a bit repetitive, especially when completing similar missions in different locations. Additionally, while the game's story is serviceable, it may not be as compelling or memorable as other titles in the genre.

Overall, The Division 2 is a must-play for fans of the looter-shooter genre, offering a compelling blend of immersive world-building, dynamic gameplay, and deep progression mechanics. Despite its minor shortcomings, it stands as a testament to Ubisoft Massive's dedication to delivering high-quality gaming experiences on the PC platform.

Looking forward to The Division 3"
76561198080105867,2221490,True,0.545454561710357666,"I'll be honest. Every title update might break something and introduce more bugs than actual new features. Gameplay is super fun but also frustrating at times. Game was stuck in limbo for the last 2-3 years but I want to give props to the remaining Dev team for keeping this game floating all these years and finally reviving with Project Resolve. As TU 20 bought some really meaningful and much needed changes to the game. ü´°


I already own the game on Ubisoft Connect and clocked more than 2000 hours on my main character. Repurchased it again because I want my most played game on Steam library  :')"

76561198083950471,2221490,True,0.536191165447235107,"This is basically Borderlands.  However, instead of being set in a fantasy/sci-fi environment, it is instead set in a more realistic post-apocalyptic setting using modern day firearms. All this with a very ""Ubisoft"" feel and finish to the game in terms of the open world mechanics and gameplay loop etc. 

If you like shooting and looting (lots of looting), then you will enjoy this.  The game engine is smooth and responsive, the shooting and looting is super fun.

I was a little unsure if this game was for me because I generally prefer single player games. Also, the always online requirement was off-putting for me.  However, I have found no major issues so far after around 25 hours.  

One thing that does suck a bit is because it has an always online requirement, this means that sometimes you cannot access the game at all if the Ubisoft servers are down for maintenance.  This sucks if you just want to play single player.  However, server maintenance will hopefully not be too frequent (only happened to me once so far when it was down for 3 hours).   

Overall, would definitely recommend.  I bought this bad boy with a 70% off promotion.  Worth every penny."

Not so open world focused where you can leave your trucks parked around the map until you need them.

After a super stagnant half decade, 25 makes a great number of both tangible gameplay benefits and quality of life improvements in its crown jewel, primary mode. The player development lab is SHOCKINGLY well balanced. The meta will absolutely be turning corner outfielders into center fielders, but other than that this is far from busted and has a surprisingly wide variety of outcomes. They clearly put the time into this it deserves, and it provides the biggest shakeup in OOTP's already incredibly deep gameplay I've seen in my 6+ years of playing. 

The new color scheme is hideous and some UI decisions were certainly questionable (while others were pretty good!), other than that I'm really impressed. Great job, team. Just please make each of the 5 rating increments on the 20-80 scale different colors again or at least someone upload a workshop skin that does the same.

The past few years if you were an offline only singleplayer player, I would not have recommended an upgrade. 25 has changed that, it's worth the upgrade, especially while it's 30% off on launch week."

The game gets better and better every year, and the devs are some of the most supportive, responsive, and creative developers out there for this style of game. The OOTP forums are a goldmine and the devs respond to everything.

I highly recommend buying this game, and attempting to join an online league. It's the best way to play the game and is one of the most competitive ""franchise"" experiences out there. My online league, PSD, is now on its 10th iteration of this game, and our league is better and more competitive than ever.

Lastly, I play 2k hours + on every yearly addition to this game. From OOTP15 to OOTP 24, my lowest hours on any game was 1,500. I highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone with even the slightest interest in something like this. Support the devs and help them continue to build fantastic games."

Strength:
- Easier than many open world water titles and able to scale difficulty up and down. 
- Has it's own charms and pulls off water world concept pretty good.

Where it struggles: (This is early access, but where I felt the game struggled)
-I will say it needs to be balanced more
-combat feels very cheap
-feels like someone took unity assets and threw them around.
- It feels like a cheap engine
- No notification of raids, just sorta happens when you don't know. 

Who would I recommend this for? Not hardcore players or people expecting stranded deep quality. 

Final thoughts for people thinking about buying it: 

- No fancy animations or graphics, just go and play. There is an optional tutorial but otherwise it's open world with multiplayer options. 

- Game for anyone honestly, it's not scary unless you fear the deep and the enemies are laughable unless you have raid on. Would suggest not having raid unless you wanna be raided everyday.

- Difficulty: Fairly Easy. No super realism, able to control the difficulty to your liking, but do know that combat kinda sucks. 

- It's a good small game but rough around the edges, definitely needs more TLC. But as is, it's enjoyable and has plenty of content for some hours. Just once again, don't expect high quality."

TLDR: It's so-so... If I could go back and refund, I would. It takes way more than 2 hours to figure out if you like it or not.
It was fun at first until I finally got to the building which was well beyond refund... 
It might be fine for you, but it's not for me. 

The quests are more annoying than fun. 
The dialogue is too modern. 
There's a lot of back and forth between points, or waiting seasons out. 
Quests pay less than selling a ton of meat. 
If you steal items, you can only sell them to other villages.
Some sleeping people magically see you steal their stuff and you lose reputation. 
If you kill a farm animal, and no one is around, you lose reputation.
There are no guards, or consequences for stealing.
You can't attack people other than bandits.
You can wait out seasons by sleeping. You wake up perfectly healthy and all the vendors are restocked. Camps are refilled with people, 
Loot-able buildings do not re-spawn, but that's fine. 
Once you've explored all the major POIs and looted them, there's no reason to revisit. 
Mines re-spawn ore, and you can find copper, tin, iron, and salt in the same mine. 
You mine an entire cliff-side for a couple limestone and a few stone.

The survival? Eat and drink. 
The only real true danger seems to be bears when there's more than one. 
Tree cutting is a pain. Chop, fall, chop, pick up, dig the stump. 3 logs for Birch, 4 for Pine, and 5 for Maple no matter the size of the tree.
Over abundance of animals, food, and drinking water with absolutely no consequence to drinking from a swamp.
In co-op, the bandits don't seem to re-spawn at their locations. There don't seem to be any random bandits.
A lot of the items are for decoration. Many of those cannot be sold, only placed in world. 
Most items are useless. 

Building is slow until you get some people set up to gather materials. It starts getting faster.
You have to start off micromanaging all your people and their assets until you get everything set up. 
People that tell you that they're good at something don't tell you exactly what it is. You can't see their status until you've made them a member of your town. 
You need to buy every schematic instead of learning it. It's all super expensive compared to your reward for questing.
You have to wait for your tech experience to level up for each different thing to unlock the ability to even buy schematics.
You can sell whatever you want to whoever you want until they're out of money. Then you have to wait until the next season to get more money. 
You only need 500 reputation to ask people to move in. 
Keeping them happy is easy, even when you're micromanaging them.

It became a grind, and I lost interest. I was just running back and forth and waiting out seasons just trying to earn money for more town abilities. So far, I only found one special item as a quest reward from a dishonest hunter."

Judging by the number of hours I played recently, yes, I think I enjoy this game :)

Medieval Dynasty can be played 
- Solo: [i]The Valley[/i] mode, in which you control a specific character.
- Co-op OR Solo: [i]The Oxbow[/i] mode, in which you are able to play your own character.

I play both modes and they're both great. You start from nothing and have to gather the basic resources to start building your settlement.


[b]What I enjoy[/b]

‚Ä¢ Developing technologies (=earning points) by doing activities such as mining and building for example (building technology) or crafting items, cooking (production technology). There are more technologies than these two. More advanced technologies stay locked until you have enough points to unlock them.

‚Ä¢ The management section where you manage your population: where they live, where they work, what they produce, etc. This section also shows the dynasty's reputation (important), workers, buildings... and what you have to pay in taxes.

‚Ä¢ Various skills trees: extraction, farming, survival, production and more.

‚Ä¢ The beautiful environment and landscapes. Also, just like in real life there are 4 seasons, when a season changes, so does the weather and temperature. While exploring you can come across wild animals (and some of them are not friendly unfortunately) such as foxes, deer, wolves, boars, lynxes...

‚Ä¢ The ability to have your own farm! You can have so many different animals: geese, hens, donkeys, sheep... I.LOVE.IT \o/

‚Ä¢ The music. Quite relaxing. I enjoy it.


This is a real pleasure to play this game, it's great in solo but even better with your friend(s) or significant other. After 25 hours I found nothing negative to say and can only recommend it to base-building and/or management lovers.

76561197999057053,1129580,False,0.573073744773864746,"Played for two-three hours on normal, quit due to frustration.

The good:
- Nice graphics (nothing to be wowed by, but definitely not Valheim level)
- Lots of things to do

The bad (hopefully constructive feedback for any developer looking at comments)
- The item transfer interface is dog shit. 
Whoever designed it needs a pay cut. You have to select the item you want to transfer, press F, press E to select all the items, then press F again to confirm. FOUR FUCKING button presses to transfer ONE item from inventory to storage.
Suggestion: Button to transfer ALL non-equipped items to storage or button to transfer the full stack. Either should be very simple to implement.
- The quick selection wheel is anything but. 
You press the quick selection wheel, point to the item you want to QUICKLY select, then have to click. ALL other quick wheels I've seen in games just need you to release the button once you land on the item you want to QUICKLY select.
Suggestion: Point to the thing - release - select thing. Simple.
- The combat/hunting mechanics are atrocious. 
If you hunt a deer, they will dodge unexpectedly as soon as you launch your spear.
You are limited by stamina, so you can't run after them forever, while they seem to have unlimited stamina.
They take 4-6 thrown spears to kill and it takes you about 1 minute to even build a spear. Oh...and spears lose durability after being thrown regardless if you hit or miss (about 20% per throw, if I'm not mistaken).
Spears sometime ""stick"" in them, sometimes they fall off, so you need to backtrack to find your spears after you eventually get the kill.
So running around with about 12 spears, after you find some deer, you go stealthy and throw your first spear. This is the easiest throw since they usually stand still grazing. After, the chase begins. You'll miss half the spears and you'll be out of stamina about 3 times before you get the kill. Then you have to skin the thing for its resources and backtrack to get the spears that didn't stick or rebuild those that got broken. ONE single successful kill will take you about 10 minutes in total. Then you need to search again for the group of deer and restart your boss fight (it feels like every deer is a fucking boss fight).
Bows seem to be even worse, since you aim with right click and shoot with left. But aiming only plays an animation where the character notches the arrow, then resets to the regular ""stance"". No change in the HUD, no actual aiming mechanic. So you don't know if you're aiming or not.
Using spears in melee is pointless, since the deer never stop running and the attack animation (and probably damage) looks like the character is trying to tickle its prey.
Fought a wolf once, just ran circles around me and could not land even a single melee hit.
Fought a badger at night. After running from me for about a minute, it turned around and attacked me 10 times in 5 seconds. Instakill from a critter that is 10 times smaller than you.
Saw some bears about 20 meters from a house that seemed lootable.
Went in to get the loot (which covers your entire screen by the way), started getting attacked by the bear through the walls. First swipe took 95% of HP while I was picking items up. Second swipe death.
Suggestions:
- Make the bows better to control/better animated in 3rd person (I'll try in first person, maybe that's where the dev focus went)
- Make the melee animation and the hit registration more ""impactful"" so I know when I'm hitting something. Also, maybe make melee weapons do more damage since there is no dodge mechanic that I could find. This is not darksouls for farmers or if it is, give us a dodge mechanic.
- Make the deer slower after it was hit by a FUCKING spear in its side, make it lose health over time so I only chase it after my initial hit, make all spears that hit stick or make them die faster. 
- Make barriers (like the walls of a house) impenetrable to animal attacks. So I can get some cover, considering most are faster than the humans and appear to have unlimited stamina.

I don't mind a game being grindy, with a high difficulty or with minor mechanics bugs, but please don't compound all of these together. It makes for a poor experience, especially for newer players."

Unlike most survival crafting type games, you have quite alot to do in this game and while the dynasty aspect MAY be a bit underexploited.... this game invites you to play slowly, and roleplay a little bit.
There's a tech tree that's both quite fast to unlock if you build quickly, and both enough of a grind that you can't unlock most things in less than 5 years so that you need to keep progressing, because this is meant to be played over in-game DECADES after all...

This is definitely the type of game where I recommend to deliberately go to bed at night even if you don't need to, to deliberately stay indoors and do more crafting in winter because... that's what people had to do when it was too cold and nothing grew outside. Spend time really thinking about where your house goes, if you want a garden and decorate with the cheapest upgrades first, to later on add some organic evolution and gradually enrich and grow your little hamlet into a small town. Give your NPC villagers a story, and custom houses, basically... have fun with it :D

It plays well with the coop mode they released although the Oxbow map is much smaller than the singleplayer map and I find that there may be less spots for a cool village.... but it's still plenty big enough for me at least.

One thing I think the game is missing and I hope the devs do eventually add is simply more customisation (more clothes mainly), more things to do (perhaps the villagers could have more needs like new clothes regularly, social events...), more buildings/decorations (bridges, wooden paths, fortifications, rugs...) and perhaps a more gradual tiering of buildings (stone houses are by far the best AND easiest to build.... and there's no incentive to keep wattle or wood houses apart from esthetics)"

Its grindy AF. you will have to grind mats a lot to do the simplest of things.
AI is just moronic. It would seem that Animal AI is closed into small circles of area that they are allowed to roam. it would be fine but that area also locks them into running away form the player. You will see deers following an invisible wall and doing donuts and using same escape paths multiple times and its immersion breaking.
Bandit ""AI"" is even worse. I never had my village attacked. I dont even know if thats something that happens. I would assume so cause in solo/coop map you start after your caravan was ambushed.
You will find enemy AI camps and they are limited to how far they can follow you. Once you find that distance you can snipe them or make them run back to their base or towards you by making 2 steps forward of backwards.
Even after opting into ""fast build"" game is painfully slow. Without it game is unbearable. ""Building"" something is just you clicking a button. and you gonna click it a lot. piece of a wall needs 1 log and 8 sticks? you gonna click it 9 times. yes ONE STICK AT THE TIME. And smallest house has 8 wall pieces, same goes for rooftops. straw? well i hope you like picking 40 straw 1 by 1 and then placing them 1 by 1 to finish a roof.

Villagers are plain retarded. You can have a kitchen full fo food and they will starve cause YOU didnt place food in each house chest seperately for them to eat. same with Water. Want them to work and you placed all required tools into a barn or any other storage building? well good luck! They wont work cause the chest in their respective building needs to have these tools. not your storage building. make a guy that makes tools for others? YOU need to move them cause villagers are too retarded to move them themselvs.
its just one huge painfull experience overall.
Maps are too small. they seem big but they arent. Maybe 2 by 2km big.
Combat is trash. Spears are your best friend. Ignore everything else.
Quests are just plain stupid. Kill 5 boars cause they are runing crops around the village. Go to the other side fo the map and boars still count to your quest even tho that these boards never saw a field.
Find 5 differences in 2 almost identical houses cause one of the peasants is mad that the other is copying him. And now there is no in game notes or any way to actually know what the convo will be before you talk to he NPC. These two are littered with crap inside. at least 20 items. furs that doesnt come with tooltips on wtf that fur is supposed to be but the quest requires you to pick a correct option. Flower hangers. again with no tooltips. different flowers are on both. And you have to guess what they are cause the game doesnt show you. Learn how the flower looks in game. try to identify it on your own. remember it and then find 4 other craps that npc cares about that is different.

It features a fairly complex village management system. But the interface is a bit clunky, combat is half baked, tutorials are insufficient, and there are lots and lots of bugs. Overall, this game can be enjoyed for the right price and maybe you'll come back time and time again with each major bug fix or update. In a way, it's good to see updates from the developer. However, do not pay full price. Buyer's remorse is a powerful thing that will make you regret going over the Steam 2 hour refund window."

Game lacks simple core mechanics of colony sims AND survival games to make it actually good recommended game. Like they try to build a car but only with 2 front wheels and at least it's a FWD.

I was eager for the concept once I saw it but it falls flat into boringness of that world. Why? You just build stuff and put villagers in there and they produce about 18% of your player's capacity (mostly cause they don't need to run around to take stuff from storage and you need). You only need provide them with wood and food and roof (build and forget). That's all. 
Hunting fun only against agressive animals cause it makes your heart pump and actually engage in process with interest. In coop that could be ridiculously fun. Bandits are fun, especially when you don't expect them. They won't come to your village to cut your people out though. That's all.

No plague, no overworking farmer that must pay tribute with cabbages to his lord or death, no religios zealots, no conflicts between anyone, no knights or castles or tournaments. Only time period for this fully sterile or ultra pasterilized ""Medieval"". But that is how I see fully used potential. 

Aside from that game is overly cheerful and full of jokes and intimate female voice acting plus who's into that - soft spoken german accent man. Could be fun? Yeah if you won't reach point of frustration that I reached with governing settlement's mechanics. Like changing worksheets with every season change... Or getting fully lost with crops and why the hell farmers can't finish sowing. Uninformative interface in terms of problems. If you bake super cake... doesn't matter for your people... easier to just pour them swamp water and simple most boring bread, they don't care... same calories."

SOME resources are less tedious to find in this game (except for lithium and lead) but that seems to be the only real positive I can say about it. Gone is the mystery and fear of the endless ocean of the first game, that's been replaced with a claustrophobic, island sized ocean that's uninteresting and far less varied, with way less biomes and variety in how the biomes look than the original game had. Gone is the awesome Cyclops submarine, replaced with a meet-in-the-middle Seatruck that tries to combine the Cyclops and the Seamoth from the first game with mediocre results. The enemies are much less varied in the way they move or interact with you or other wildlife in the world. The writing is hamfisted, going from a silent protagonist in the first game to a person who says bits of pieces of information out loud to herself, and none of it ever seems to ever teach you or mean anything. The first game rewarded players for paying attention to research logs, PDA's, and figuring out what you're supposed to do from context clues, where in this game everything is just kind of shoved in your face. It really just feels like a mediocre expansion to the first game instead of a sequel or spin off. The worst part is the game really increased the amount of on land sections compared to the first game, which were my least favorite part. Going and looking for a base on an iceberg, that looks like every other iceberg in the game, with weather effects spamming your screen every 3-5 seconds so you can't see anything just results in utter frustration. I am hopeful Subnautica 2 will take the small improvements this game has and realise what made the first so great, and deliver a true sequel."

Very cool puzzle game with many small escape rooms that aren't that easy sometimes so u can spend some time on few levels. It also contains 2 free DLCs, 2 paid ones and more coming soon. Every DLC adds new escape rooms and what is interesting, Portal level is a one very big room rather than a few small ones which is also a great idea. There is also map editor and community levels that are really great and advanced. I absolutely recommend to play it witch ur friend.

Achievments are quite easy, u just need to find all collectibles, complete the game and do some miscellaneous things that are easy to come up with when u read achievemen names.

DLCs are not required for any achievements."

Pros: 
- Victorian themed rooms were fun and intuitive 
- A decent amount of content 

Cons: 
- Buggy asf. We didn't trophy a room because one of the puzzles required us to put ingredients in the fire in order, and the second ingredient floated in the fire instead of burning. We had to do it 3 times before it registered.
- Battery in a space room kept glitching in and out through the floor.
- Items dropped out of bounds usually respawn in the middle of the room, but some items can get stuck at an angle with an invisible wall (Egypt top of pyramid room). Had to keep throwing an object at it to try and knock it out of bounds so it could respawn. 
- The controls are clunky. 
- Can't share item inventory, and trying to read a page with a friend makes the item drop.

I have been addicted to this game since its launch, but after looking at what they've done to it, I'll just continue ignoring it. It might be nostalgia, but the golden age of blitz was between 2016-2018 when the devs were focused on expanding tech trees, adding new mechanics, and new maps. In 2019, the game started venturing into an overly arcade experience with the introduction of mad games. It was okay as a once-in-a-year event for Halloween as it was a nice break from the otherwise monotonous gameplay.

I got into Blitz as a way to get the WoT experience on mobile. I have always admired military history so I was glad that the game was relatively faithful with its tech tree choices. Sure, some tanks like the Grille were never produced but at least the drawings were created for it. In my book, Wargaming has always been the go-to place for alternate history nerds that like to experience those ""what-if"" tanks. Sadly, the Dracula event opened the pandoras box for ""fake"" tanks. As a person that originally got the Dracula through it's maiden event, I was happy to hear that it was based on IRL amx tank. I don't have an issue with dressing up a tank an event. However, the Helsing was clearly fake. I didn't have a problem with it as it was a special holiday tank; I just don't want my lobbies filled with unrealistic tank designs with overpowered armor layouts and/or guns that can only be acquired through what can only be called an arms race..."

I spent plenty of money in the game to get some premium vehicles, which I ended up stop using because it was not funny anymore, the reason is simple, when you get premium vehicles you have a right chance to play only with them because the standard tanks are not funny anymore as premiums are. So in conclusion the game came from a normal WoT for mobile segment to a fantasy colourful tank battle game which was not my game style so I stopped playing it and went to War Thunder looking something less arcade.

Again... Good game in 2015-2020, after that the game started to go into something different that I personally didn't enjoy. F good old World of Tanks Blitz my childhood game that I will never forget for bringing joyful moments when I was with depression alone in the world."

The same applies to your fellow comrades. So, expect a vivid mix of ups and downs. I guess if you have a little experience, you should know what to expect.

A few words about the game though:

After the introduction, the core gameplay consists of 7-minute battles of 7 vs. 7 on small maps. So you can always squeeze in a a battle here and there if you like.

There are four different tank types (light, medium, heavy, destroyers) that technically serve different roles and 10 different tiers/levels. You will move through the first 5 or 6 tiers very quickly and think you're the greatest, However, it is commonly recommended to remain in Tier 7 for a while and move forward slowly, as the opponents become gradually more difficult from there onwards. Jumping tiers often leads to frustrated players and team mates.

You can obtain various tech-tree tanks by playing the game, but you can also buy so-called Premium and Collector tanks. With a little patience and time, you can get some of these ""paid tanks"" through good offers (watch ads and do quests for gold) or even for free e. g. from one of the occasional events.

Relax, take your time and you can achieve a lot without spending a dime.

On a final note: Though paid tanks seem to dominate tier 8 more and more, based on the previous points I think it's okay (for now)."

The new matchmaking system, while aiming for balance, punishes skilled players. Instead of having fair competition, it's creating scenarios where skilled individuals are matched with less experienced players. This might sound like a good idea however if the opposing team has all 50% (Wr) winrate players and I am a 60%(Wr) the matching-making will give me 40%(Wr) players to balance me out leading to unfair teams and one-sided battles. This is also affecting 40%(Wr) players since if you are not as good at the game you will be given one or two really good players hoping they can carry, unfortunately, this is a team game and if you have a bad team MOST of the time you cannot win. Wargaming will not change this because they want everyone to be 50% winrate which is what this matchmaking update is trying to do. It's sad to see such a misguided update implemented, especially when it undermines the core principles of fair competition and skill development within the game. Players should be rewarded for their dedication and skill, not punished for striving to improve. Ultimately, the decision-makers behind this update need to reevaluate their approach and look for solutions that allow for balanced gameplay without sacrificing the integrity of skill-based matchmaking. Instead, they could have balanced matchmaking by making it so one team doesn't get 3 tier 10 medium tanks and the other gets 1 tier 9 medium tank...Failure to address this new matchmaking system will lead to dedicated players leaving and WILL affect the long-term sustainability of the game."

Makes beautiful maps like demon island unplayable. its sad, because i picked this game up in 2020 and it used to be so much more aggressive and winning felt great. Now its just a headache to get through a match win or lose. I tried to smurf to see if things was different outside of diamond, but nope just as bad.

Brawl with heavy string, cool highlights, smart agro, exciting plays to passive, reset neatural, two hits, drastically less strings, corner running, bait out with movement, and slowing the game down to the max.

76561199612023481,1190000,True,0.523809552192687988,This game is just so relaxing and satisfying. I must recommend it to everyone.
76561198097517831,1190000,False,0.523809552192687988,"This is such a good concept for a game, and I‚Äôm not just saying that because it appeals directly to me. With the popularity of games like House Flipper, PowerWash Simulator, Viscera Cleanup Detail, and PC Building Simulator, Car Mechanic Simulator fits right in, but with the added fun (or ""fun"") of there being a lot of small parts to bolt together instead of simply cleaning or decorating, and it‚Äôs decently accessible since everything is heavily simplified, visibility is much better than it is in reality, and every bolt is highlighted unless you play in expert mode like me. These games have a zen-like appeal to them, and for a few hours, I felt it. But after those few hours, not only did the appeal wear off, I began to resent the existence of the game.

I have three major problems with this game.

First: Progression sucks. There actually is a progression in this game, and that‚Äôs great, I love the concept of starting in a run down shop with basic tools and slowly working your way up to a better shop with better tools by doing simple jobs and slowly expanding your services. The problem is that‚Äôs not how it works here. You do start in a run down shop, but the tools you use never change, you only make them faster by leveling up, which happens very slowly, even on expert where XP gain is doubled. I think that‚Äôs a huge letdown, not just because it means everything is artificially slow ‚Äì including your movement speed! ‚Äì for a long time in the beginning, but because it kills any sense of gameplay variety there could have been by having different types of tools, like starting with hand tools, then upgrading to power tools, then air tools, something like that. As for expanding your services, you do have extra facilities to buy, like a paint booth, an alignment station, and a second lift. Problem is I don‚Äôt see any of those extras ever being necessary for the jobs. The jobs themselves are underwhelming too, because there‚Äôs a set of ‚Äústory‚Äù orders that seem intended to slowly ramp up the complexity, but it felt more like a massive spike followed by inconsistent ups and downs. Money also comes extremely slowly‚Ä¶ until it suddenly doesn‚Äôt. All jobs (except transmission jobs) have such small margins that saving up for all the upgrades or a cool car feels almost impossible, but the moment I had enough to buy a wrecked Porsche from the junkyard and fully restore it, boom, 130,000 profit, quadrupled my money. Money was no longer an object, just like that. Why is it like this?

Second: The gameplay is arbitrary. Some parts require the car to be lifted up even though the part is clearly accessible from the top, or to be on the ground even though the part is clearly accessible from the bottom. For some tasks ‚Äì like taking an engine out ‚Äì some cars suffer so bad from this that they have to go up and down a few times just to do that singular task. Or with engines, for instance, many parts on engines have far fewer bolts than they would really have, which is clearly a design choice to reduce the monotony for the sake of making a fun game‚Ä¶ and yet, you still have to remove and replace every camshaft cap individually? Worse still the sheer monotony of the repair and scrap minigames, which are done one part at a time, meaning you could be left playing the same minigame about a hundred times in a row after a full restoration from the barn. Worse still, the repair minigame often must be done multiple times per part, and the scrap minigame rewards you with such a pitiful amount of scrap that I didn‚Äôt even have enough to fully upgrade one engine after scrapping several entire cars worth of parts and getting nearly a thousand scrap as bonuses from the loot crates. Also, there are loot crates and I hate that.

Finally: The driving sucks. It didn‚Äôt need to be here, but it is, and it sucks, so I‚Äôm complaining about it. It‚Äôs genuinely some of the worst driving I‚Äôve ever experienced in a game that wasn‚Äôt broken. Weightless and floaty, yet simultaneously impossibly grippy with brakes that feel more like hitting a series of walls than brakes. The sound is also impressively bad, indescribably bad for a game that is specifically about cars, up close and personal. I will say with 100% certainty and no hyperbole whatsoever ‚Äì I know how often this phrase is hyperbolic to the extreme, but I am being fully genuine here ‚Äì there are PS1 games that do car sounds better than this, and even some budget bin ones that give a better driving experience. Emphasis on budget bin, because I know Gran Turismo got its start on the PS1 and that‚Äôs an unfair comparison. Any one of these issues being better would dramatically improve the whole experience, but as it is, there are zero redeeming qualities.

I could complain about more things. Like the graphics being kind of bad, not just because it looks like a ‚Äúnintendo, hire this man‚Äù type of game sometimes what with the horrific over-detailing on some things and ridiculous hyper-shininess of other things without even mentioning all the bloom, but also because ambient occlusion is flat out broken and reflections are buggy. Or the fact that the tutorial is practically nonexistent and most definitely isn‚Äôt enough for a lot of people, which leaves them confused and overwhelmed the moment it‚Äôs over. Or the very clunky menu controls that are impressively unintuitive. Or the music so loud and unfitting that I made an ugly face at it. Or the fact that some of these cars are laughably unrealistic, like the officially licensed paid-DLC RX-7 having extremely incorrect suspension and twin turbos that look like [url=https://kerosyn.link/wp-content/uploads/car-mechanic-simulator-2021-nonsensical-twin-turbo.avif]whatever this is[/url] for some reason. But I won‚Äôt.

In the end, this feels like a game where the developers simply didn‚Äôt even try to make something good and engaging. That may sound harsh, but this is the fourth Car Mechanic Simulator, and they all play exactly the same. There have been zero meaningful changes or additions to the formula in ten years, and the result is a rehashing of a ten year old game that already got boring after only a few short hours when you realize that you‚Äôve already seen everything and there is nothing left to do. All that‚Äôs changed is an increase in paid DLC, some of which costs more individually than some other entire excellent games, and all of which adds precisely nothing to the game since there is effectively no capacity for creativity in the game in the first place that could benefit from additional cosmetic items and licensed cars. I guess it‚Äôs an alright podcast game, something monotonous to keep you busy while you listen to something monotonous to pass the time‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt want a podcast game, I want a satisfying experience, and this really could have been that if it only cleared the lowest possible bar by having at least one gameplay component that isn‚Äôt a failure. All the other games I mentioned in the opening paragraph are that, and I‚Äôd rather play any one of them over this. I would rather play an idle game than this.

This is way longer than it should be considering that this is the grab bag ‚Äì the section on this game alone is almost long enough to be the longest entire grab bag post so far on its own ‚Äì but I just plain didn‚Äôt want to give this game the grace of getting its own dedicated post.

I do not say this lightly: I hate this game."

I am not a fan of how much of a grind it is to get to Chaos 100 (you gain 5 Chaos levels for each Chaos Trial run completion until 50, then only 1 until 100).

I never picked up a tool except the thermal paste to show him how to set it.

The first game we played all the way through together was BL2. We live half way across the continent of North America, but through gaming and this franchise in particular, we have spent countless hours searching for vaults and unravelling the twisted adventures of the vault hunters. It kept us connected.

This game has the simple get-in-and-get shooting fun of the first game. The humour of the second and Space Jam. And the mechanics and gun variety of the third.

it may not be for everyone, but this franchise is near and dear to my heart and I love the approach they took to tell it from Tiny Tina's point of view. lots of fun. Don't overthink it. Just shoot."

The story is just stupid fun. Dialogue isn't as bad as Borderlands 3 although in some parts of the game it was reaching. Some funny moments, a bit emotional at times.

My main issue with the game is that it is a Borderlands game yet it doesn't have any replayability. There's no new game+, no true vault hunter mode. You just finish the game and that's it. 

The classes feel dull, not much personality to speak of unlike in the other Borderlands games. Same thing goes for the whole story and variety of weapons.

The combat is trivial even on the highest difficulty, with the exception of environmental hazards (barrels) which are literally everywhere and almost always can kill you through full shield/health.

The guns are fine, there are some unique gimmicks which is the strong point of bl weapons. The classes are kind of interesting. The core of the game has a lot of potential, it's just the environments and writing that ruin it.

The writing is abysmal. There's SO MUCH dialogue and most of it is cringe-worthy. You can tell the writers thought they were clever and funny, and they spend a lot of time trying to convince you of it as well. I wish they were successful.

Looked for ways around it, but it seems like it's simply a new sale option Steam offers to publishers. Steam used to simply exempt the already owned items in a package and charge you the same. I was gonna ask some friends to buy it, but no longer see the point.

About the (base) game: It's alright. Not as memorable as BL2, but more replay-able than BL3. Once you get to the endgame you will need the unique items from the DLC to get a good build running, which is why I was looking for the DLC. None of them seem worth their full price. (The price of the season pass is simply insulting)

76561198142240652,1286680,False,0.515725016593933105,"Ah Wonderlands. I really like the premise and the settings. Fantasy with gun really intrigues me, as I am a fan of Assault on Dragon Keep DLC from Borderlands 2. Gameplay wise is identical with BL3 with simplified Skill Tree. It is designed like because you can dual class in this game. But you can only equip 1 action skills active tho. 

Grenade has been retooled into an actual spells now, there's quite a variety of it. From simple magic missile to summoning a meteor rains. Melee weapon is also a thing now, You can equip swords, clubs, scythe, etc. And you also got 2 ring slot and necklace accessories slot for stat boost. But as a result, they really diluted the loot pool. I swear I seen more melee weapon drops more than actual guns. 

Story is actually good. Dragon Lord is a good written villain. Which is a surprise since Borderlands 3 writing is garbage and New Tales writing is also garage (this one even released after Wonderlands, go figure). Idk what the hell happened at Gearbox lmao. 

And then there's the endgame. Hoo boi. While I like the premise of Chaos chambers (I actually wished for something like randomized dungeon / arena way back in BL2 days), the Chaos Levels themselves is grindy as fuck. There's like 100 of them. No way in hell I'm doing like 50+ chaos runs to get to that level. Also the game really incentives you to run Chaos Chamber more because, well, Legendary drops way more common there compared to other places. They weren't kidding when they said Wonderlands endgame is garbage.

Should you get Wonderlands? If you have slight interest in this, please just get it on a deep discount. And avoid buying the DLC too since I heard its very short and not worth the money. I think this game is just fun to play from start to finish, but when you reaches the endgame, things will start to fall apart. I'm putting this on negative since -lands games usually excels on its endgame. Not this one tho.

It's funny this game is like antithesis of Borderlands 3. That game is a slog to play through the endgame (Awful story + veeeeeryyy long). but has a fun Endgame. While Wonderlands is fun to play through from start to finish, has good story and the length is on par with BL2 base game in my opinion. Endgame is pure garbage and not fun.

The writing isn't as good as Borderlands 2, but crucially, it doesn't have to be. Because it's all taking place in Tina's D&D game, the stakes are lower and the kinds of things that would seem hackish or lazy in other games work here and even have a kind of charm. 

Build variety is neat. Each class only has one tree compared to the three trees of previous games, but because you can multiclass, you effectively get any two trees in the game that you want, rather than your choice between three that you're locked into. And builds have interesting mechanical depth on par with the Pre-Sequel, but they come online much earlier. That's nice since Wonderlands has no NG+. (It's post-game consists of Chaos Chambers and DLC challenges, which you can  iterate upon to do more and more difficult things with crazier loot.)

It's not perfect. My routine complaint is that combat challenge comes heavily from the AOE elemental effects and not much from actually getting shot or hit. So when you lose, it kind of feels like it was the same reason every time.

You can host, compete in, and visit other ruler's tournaments. There are some competitions you can play in like archery and dueling, you can get some cool random events. Traveling to other tournaments usually comes from friendly rulers already but it is a good way to raise their opinion. Still, not worth the price, thirty dollars is absurd."

this trilogy is not intended to be played one after the other in order of release - all the content you own in this game can be played in the second and third games, and all the content you own in the second game can be played in the third game. the second game has a campaign called Mortal Empires that combines its standard campaign with this game's campaign in one large map, and the third game has an Immortal Empires campaign that combines all three in an even bigger map. this trilogy takes place in a fantasy setting, and necessarily plays differently from a historical Total War game; the races in this first game, however, play most similarly to the historical games - i recommend the Empire or Bretonnia to ease you into the setting, then the Vampire Counts to force you to adapt to the gameplay. get this game together with the second game for the best cross-section of the trilogy's factions, or together with the third game for the biggest campaign map and good gameplay as Chaos factions. just be aware that you will be paying incredible sums if you intend to acquire all the content available - be patient, or thrifty."

It is a proper expansion, adding to the game in every necessary way and I cannot play without it now. 

In fact, the reason I am only writing this review now is that I recently stayed at my sister's house for a few days and she let me play on her steam account and she had bought Rimworld some years ago but never got into it. I played and had a fun time, yeah, because even the base game is great but after a few hours I cannot fully express how close I was to buying Biotech for her because of how much I felt that I NEEDED it to continue playing. (I didn't because I'm broke and she wouldn't even ever play it again, but I was SO close)

The new xenotypes just fit with the world so perfectly and the mad scientist idea of making your own, let alone the modding community's expansion of this feature is phenomenal. 
The mechanoids!! I just cannot live without a cleanerbot anymore and low-tech games feel even tougher now that I've experienced them, which just adds to my love of them.
BABIES. This is my favourite part and I CANNOT play without this anymore. Having lovers come together and then maybe having full families grow together on the Rim? Perfection. THe drama of it all is just incredible.

I hadn't played any Final Fantasy games before. I decided to start with Final Fantasy XV after playing the demo, and in my opinion, the game immediately starts off strong.
    
The story grips you right from the start (spoiler alert),[spoiler] beginning with your departure from Insomnia to meet with Luna. However, as always, the journey is not an easy one... In the end of the demo, Noctis's father, Regis, dies, leaving Noctis alone with no family except for his hope in Luna[/spoiler], the demo ends at a very intriguing point, leaving me eager to continue the game and see what happens next. And what follows is even more fascinating. When you buy the game, you'll experience moments that may bring tears, shock, or joy. Overall story rating: [b]10/10[/b]

In terms of gameplay, the controls weren't difficult to manage, but I played with a gamepad because playing with a keyboard is not comfortable at all. The game is challenging to control, so I recommend playing with a gamepad to avoid frustration. It's difficult to execute combos and overall combat can be tough. If you don't have a gamepad, I don't recommend purchasing one, as it could negatively impact your opinion of the gameplay. The in-game tutorial explains everything thoroughly and introduces the game very well. There's no need to grind, unless you want to. I recommend not skipping the tutorial text if you're just starting to get familiar with the game. Overall gameplay rating: [b]9/10[/b]

There are no complaints about the audio. The sound quality is excellent, though it may not be everyone's cup of tea. I can't say it gave me a ""wow"" effect, but it's simply high-quality audio. The voice acting is top-notch, both in Russian and English (which I used during my playthrough). Overall audio rating:  [b]9/10[/b]
[hr] [b]Additional information for those interested:[/b] the graphics are top-notch, but as a result, the game is very demanding on PC. With an RTX3060 graphics card, Ryzen 3600 processor, and 32GB of RAM, I experienced crashes and freezes. However, according to reviews, this happens rarely‚ÄîI guess I'm just unlucky. The game is very demanding on high or ultra graphics settings if you want to play with such visual fidelity. There were no bugs that hindered gameplay, except for one additional online collaboration mission where characters stopped in the middle of a mission, but you can exit to the main menu using the interface. The time it takes to complete the game varies for everyone, so it's hard to say exactly how much time it will take. If you only focus on the main story, the game will take about 20-30 hours. The additional episodes take up little time.
[hr] [b]I rate the game a 9/10.[/b] There are few games with such beautiful graphics and an interesting story nowadays. The game was released in 2016 for PS, and in 2018 for PC with improved graphics. Even now, it's still relevant graphically. Few games can boast such audio quality. I hope my recommendation was helpful to you, and with that, I've said all I wanted to about the game!"
76561198025321433,637650,False,0.594539105892181396,"I am so disappointed in FF XV. I don't generally stop playing games if I am already 20 hours deep, but I feel like FF XV has just nothing to offer unless you consume one of the dozens of supplemental materials. The story is extremely confusingly told; it always seems like you miss something as characters appear and vanish with no explanation or background story. The main characters are not at all fleshed out, which is why all of them have their own DLC, which you normally wouldn't play until the end of the game, so what's the point? I have no connection to any of them, their characteristics are paper thin in the game.

I can't stress enough how badly written the story is. I rarely get to the point where I can't bring myself to care about anything happening in a game, but because of the way the story is brought across to the player, there is constant confusion, ""what?"" moments and questions about why you do the things you do. I don't think I have ever experienced something like this in even the worst-written games I ever played. This is a FF game? Really?

FF XV just feels like it was written by someone who doesn't know how to write coherent, cohesive stories as nothing seems to fit together and, in turn, nothing about this game makes me want to continue playing. There is no story that I want to see through, as there is no background or any real explanation for anything that is happening beyond surface-level ""We need to do this because we need to"". The battle system feels floaty and is extremely unsatisfying, with attacks having no weight or impact. Spells look cool, but have to constantly be refreshed, which gets annoying. Blocking is a pain and doesn't work half the time, and fighting a larger group of enemies is an exercise in frustration thanks to the terrible camera.

The side quests and hunt systems are serviceable, though many of them feel like generic MMO sidequests and they are similar in number. Because of the battle system, I did not even really want to engage in hunting though after a certain point.

FF XV also comes with a large set of smaller frustrations that make no sense. Why can I only track one quest at a time? Other quests don't show up, even if you are nearby (unless it's a hunt)/ It's very easy to drive by many quests because you have to check and activate every quest separately to track them. Speaking of driving, it's a cool idea and the landscapes of the game are pretty, but you can't easily reverse unless you're at certain crossings, so if you accidentally drive by where you want to be, either get out and hoof it or drive a LARGE detour to get back. The sound mixing of the game is ATROCIOUS, the worst I ever heard. The music is way too quiet, but then the battle music is WAY too loud, blowing your ears out every time. Some character voices are very quiet, others very loud. There are many weird small inconsistencies like this in the game - I could go on forever.

If you are able to ignore these things and are willing to watch, read or play the many supplemental shows/DLCs/novels set in the FF XV universe that probably elaborate on the background story and give a reason for anything that is happening, the game might be interesting enough to see through to the end. However, I am playing a game to play a game and to experience a self-contained story (that, if I really want to, I can expand on by reading or playing OPTIONAL material afterwards), and as a self-contained story, this might be the most confusing, characterless crockpot of a game I have ever experienced, and I don't say that lightly. 20 hours in and I feel like I have learned nothing. Even more tragically, I was looking forward to this for two years as I usually love Final Fantasy games and finally got around to play it. Heck, I even like the 13 trilogy, which is a LOT better than this. At least there, I understand what's happening and the battle system(s) don't make me want to electrocute myself.

With a heavy heart, I can't recommend FF XV at all unless you have the time and willpower to follow a long guide that describes more than a dozen additional stories, DLCs and other materials that you have to weave in and out of while playing FF XV to understand anything.

the one HUGE con imo is this is a pretty bad pc port. it kinda just eats away at ur hardware with not much to show for it. i first played this on a 3050ti r7 5800h laptop and the temps were unbelievably high and the frame rate was very inconsistent. the fps is better on my 3070ti rig, but still, it will push those temps up but needlessly pushing ur cpu up the wall. other than that this game is awesome. and theres workshop support!"

76561198013541173,552520,True,0.568723201751708984,"I am a huge fan of the Far Cry game series. The new installment continues the successful elements of the previous games: a brutal open world where most living creatures try to kill you. While the fourth installment took place in the Himalayas, this game has been set in America's state of Montana, home to a diverse range of colorful characters.
Comparisons to the previous game are inevitable. The storyline of the fifth installment was well-crafted. I particularly enjoyed the concept of a cult, a drug that brainwashes people, and a small squad on a recon mission. There are numerous beautiful details, such as a monument to the game's main antagonist, three loyal companions with their own backstories, and the opportunity to reenact the exploits of a legendary stuntman from the past.However, the videos featuring the pseudo-philosophical musings of the villains were dull. And in general, the main antagonist is inferior to the charismatic Asian character from the previous installment. In this installment, the towers that could be climbed in order to activate the map have been removed. However, there are altars and wolf beacon that need to be destroyed, as well as bomb shelters containing rewards and piles of cash that can be found on the tables.There are still a lot of missions to complete if you play through the game like me. The game can drag you out for a long time, so after going through the main menu, there are still a couple of missions left for me. One of them was to catch a salmon, which was not on the map, but luckily another task required me to get salmon for the bear. I also had difficulties finding the remaining altars and lighthouses that were mentioned earlier, as they were not displayed on the map. I had to search for them using a hint on the internet. After completing all the missions, I was surprised by the ending. It was an unexpected conclusion of the story, but it didn't affect anything in general.

As a person who played through Far Cry 1 to Far Cry New Dawn I can say that this series had it's own falls and rises. And Far Cry 5 stays somewhere in the middle. Anyway, let's get to the pros and cons.

Pros:
+ Cool partner system.
+ Decent story. It was interesting at the start, boring in the middle and cool at the end.
+ Stashes with cash are mostly interesting to solve.
+ Clutch Nixon's challenges are really cool to do especially with a friend.
+ Planes and Helicopters are really fun and good addition to the game.

Cons:
- There are some funny additional missions but most of them are boring.
- Most of the additional and even main characters feel poorly written and not interesting.
- It's mostly a game with the same mechanics and I don't mind it in some way but why remove good mechanics? For example, you don't need to hunt animals anymore because they only give you money for their skins and not an upgraded holster, etc like in previous parts.
- If you play co-op your friend will not complete the story on their character which is some straight ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• because my friend literally couldn't level up skills because the requirement is to kill a boss who we killed but it counts only for the host and he couldn't even buy guns because in his story he didn't reach a resistance level for it.

I give this game a 6/10.

Far Cry New Dawn
And I want to give a quick review of this game here as I didn't play it on Steam.

Pros:
+ Cool aesthetic design for everything. Map, animals, bikers, guns. Guns are especially cool.
+ Really cool animations on silent kills. Made me wanna say ""oof"" for that poor guy who I stabbed in the eye.
+ Story is a sequel of course. Simple and good I would say.
+ Sorties are especially cool and even unique to the series. Capturing a valuable bag and getting out in many different places is what I really enjoyed.

Cons:
- Partners are even cooler and funnier here but sometimes I don't get how they are so weak to instantly die from a lvl 1 biker.
- Kinda short for its price."

76561198024915288,49520,False,0.527472555637359619,"Not great.  In fairness, I did get 24 hours in this game, and I did play this game in 2020, about 8 years after it released.  Unlike some other games from around that time (e.g., StarCraft 2, Skyrim), Borderlands 2 did not age very well, particularly in the graphics and environment design.

Some games have that ""timeless"" look, where the art style is so strong, or that the graphic designers were so in-tune with the limitations of their system or computing hardware, that the game looks good even when rendered in 320x640 on a primitive system.  BL2's cell-shaded artstyle is not quite there.  It's weird because sometimes it looks like the promotional screenshots (i.e., good), but most of the time you're walking through these flat, low-res fields, shooting at enemies that look straight out of a PS2 game.

BL2 is a looter-shooter, combining both RPG and FPS elements.  Unfortunately, the RPG stuff (at least, through the main game content) is mostly ""get better guns"", which is mostly ""get guns that do more damage.""  Most weapons you find will be completely useless after leveling up a couple times, as enemy health scales pretty quickly, so you have to find new guns frequently.  However, guns in BL2 generally are less ""interesting"" and more ""frustrating"", shooting bullets at crazy angles , having insane recoil, exploding randomly, etc.  It was genuinely frustrating to find a gun I liked, only to shoot it for an hour or so before needing to replace it with the ClownBlaster 5000.  The core gameplay of FPSs (i.e., shoot the enemies) is generally fun, but I feel like the RPG elements in BL2 basically just made it worse.

The writing, dialog, etc., is generally mediocre.  Most of it is incredibly stupid humor, which itself is not a problem (I kinda like stupid humor).  The problem is that BL2 attempts to have actual serious moments, which are totally ineffective because of the stupid humor.  There are definitely games / movies / books that do both funny and serious well, but BL2 is not one of them.  Serious moments like a death of a major character are totally undercut by the idiocy before and after, and the main villain is cast as a ""real threat"" after spending most of the game as a total clown.

So overall kinda bad.  It would have been a bit better by the standards of 2012, and its influence on the looter-shooter genre is not negligible, but still not a particularly good game."

This review is based on Kislev and Cathay Since I don't play chaos.

Kislev
 So If I am being honest Kislev had a bunch of useless units only with this update did we finally end up getting some usefull units... and I think the star of the show of it all are the humble Kislev Warriors and the Druzhina these too make a huge difference in how you play Kislev. The elemental beast is far too along the game to use it much, the Things in the wood are usefull, the Akshina...are not that usefull in a army full of ranged units... Now, the worse addition was was the Frost wyrm it looses against everything for Ostankya she fun character. The new legendary hero is a tank, but deal very low damage.

Lore of Hag is cool but bit confusing to use, they got curses and blessings but overall really nice addition of that Lore.

I also think they should have gone a Light  Artilleryi unit than that useless Wyrm.

Cathay
 The new Lord is cool with it's Hammer and is the new hybrid  hero with its bonuses they are both useful, the Crowmen were needed and the support drum is also a nice addition.... now... the Jade and the Onyx Lion idk one lion to the Jade Lion I think is the best of the two but both have their uses. I am against the new two air units.. I think they needed something else other than re skinned Manticore and Phoenix and they play very similar to the Manticore and Phoenix. the new hero is cool it plays like moving artillery piece that can fight on melee, I think Cathay got the best in content out of the three.

Tzeench or whatever is called.
 Trash content, what worse is that if you don't own Champions of Chaos DLC (like me) the content feels really minimal... and I don't care enough for chaos to buy that DLC. so not even worth playing unless you are a Chaos fanboy. so I overpaid 20$(on sale) and I don't care about this side of the content.

 About the individual Mechanics? I could care less. I am a old school TW fan just give me a starting location and above all useful new units that fit into different niches and I am happy.  Their Mechanics to finish the game are tedious and long as hell... above all Mother Ostankya I could not finish the long game victory, I just got bored. Also these Lords are too OP, they have to many mechanics and cheap gimmicks I think this is some of the worse DLC Warhammer has ever had.


 About the starting locations? I could care less, in fact I like them Some areas need variety Nagarroth was the dullest place to play in WH2 now it has variety. I like Mother Ostankya and Yuan Bo in their locations, makes it varied.

 Not very optimistic about the rest of the coming DLC for Nurgle, Slaneesh and Khorne. I think they need to fix the AI to be mroe active both allies and enemies and add more diplomatic options like Liberate and vassalage(for AI and player)


Dang it... how much I miss the FLC lords..."

This takes me back to OG PC gaming days. base games good, launch was rough, but the dedicated modders really brought it alive. the Yet another MechLab mod (YAML) and other sick mods really open the game up to being a very sick experience. 

the main mode is a whole map of missions and building rep and getting better gear to customize and growing your unit.
Getting 3 other friends and going through the campaign (once you have enough pilots) or doing a career mode that you can start with everyone immediately is a ride. (Host holds the save files so remember who has the save) and most importantly. if one person has the DLC so does everyone else. so if one person has all the DLC then its all free game for your friends. 
If you decide to play this game and want to rock a flight stick, highly recommend adding the Auto aim to ease some pains and check guides for setting it all up."

For the most part this isn't a problem at all as most of the puzzles are simple and self explanatory enough to where it isn't challenging. However every once in a while I run into something so obtuse that it takes me out of the relaxing experience altogether and introduces frustration.

An example is a puzzle with a clock where the only mechanic is moving the hands of the clock forward and backward. Seems simple, but I got quite stuck on it. The actual solution is that [spoiler] there is a background of leaves that moves around when you change the time, and you are meant to line up the hour hand of the clock with a leaf sillouette. [/spoiler] Unfortunately there aren't any visual indicators of what this win condition is and it was significantly less intuitive than other puzzles in this game. In another game,  they would likely start you off by atleast introducing you to the rules, then gradually giving you increasingly difficult puzzles. However with this, the rule isnt obvious since each puzzle has a totally different ""win"" condition and once you do figure it out, instead of then ramping up the difficulty by adding complexity, it takes you immediately to a new puzzle with a different ruleset

As a puzzle game, I think its not super satisfying since most of the puzzles are a bit too easy. As a zen-like experience, I found the peace occasionally disrupted by a very unintuitive puzzle that left me frustrated"

From the moment I first stepped into the shoes of Jill Valentine, navigating the treacherous streets of Raccoon City, I was captivated by the intense and immersive experience it offered.

""Resident Evil 3"" holds a special place in my heart for several reasons. Firstly, its gripping storyline filled with suspense, mystery, and survival elements kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire gameplay. The relentless pursuit of Nemesis, the iconic antagonist of the game, added an extra layer of tension and excitement, making every encounter with him a pulse-pounding experience.

Moreover, I cannot help but marvel at the game's stunning visuals and atmospheric design. From the dilapidated streets to the eerie interiors of abandoned buildings, every environment is meticulously crafted to evoke a sense of dread and isolation. The attention to detail in bringing Raccoon City to life truly immerses players in its nightmarish world.

Furthermore, ""Resident Evil 3"" offers a perfect balance of action and survival horror gameplay. The strategic decision-making, resource management, and intense combat sequences kept me thoroughly engaged from start to finish. Whether I was carefully conserving ammunition or facing off against hordes of grotesque creatures, every moment felt exhilarating and rewarding.

Beyond its gameplay mechanics, ""Resident Evil 3"" also boasts memorable characters and a compelling narrative that kept me invested in the fate of Jill and her companions. The evolution of Jill's character as she confronts her fears and fights for survival resonated with me on a deeply emotional level.

In conclusion, my love for ""Resident Evil 3"" knows no bounds. It is a game that has left an indelible mark on me, not only as a fan of the survival horror genre but also as a gamer who appreciates rich storytelling and immersive gameplay experiences. I cannot recommend it highly enough to anyone seeking an adrenaline-fueled adventure into the heart of darkness.

With warm regards,

Limoen"

The fight system is tricky at first, but I got quickly into it, it's just different than other games you might know. The castle building got way better in the second big expansion and I can't wait for the new features in 2024. The world is nicely designed, all the locations, the lore behind it, interesting, but not ""pushy"", just the way I like it.
The only thing I was a bit dissapointed with was the last single-player boss - I didn't feel any special motivation to kill him other than to finish the game; no ""special reward"" afterwards and he does not feel like a final; but I might be a freak who wants a big scary weird looking monster in some inaccessible den who will drop you an ultimate golden throne with diamonds, yeah...

However......after 250 hours in-game it's really starting to pee me off to the point that I'll probably not bother finishing the game - genuine stealth is almost impossible, enemies seem to home-in on the player character once any alarm is raised (which, despite your best efforts will be often) and their aim is nothing short of Olympic standard. I was prone behind a rock outcrop and three gunmen still managed to shoot me [i]through the rock[/i]... I had no line of sight to them.
Quickly becomes repetitive and you'll soon recognise the cut-and-paste landscape.
Weapon customisation is good but some of the in-game characteristics are questionable - the British L115 sniper rifle, for example, is quoted as having been used for the longest ever sniper kill - but its range and accuracy in game are middling at best....

*Great Character artwork

*Fun (but im simplistic) combat
*Sci fi mixed with fantasy
*Alot of crafting/buffing mechanics (enjoyed those alot)

Cons:
*Story is okay but nothing to write home about
The game would have scored much higher for me if the story and characters were much more interesting

When i FINALLY got my hands on a copy of it, i was ecstatic! It IT NOT DISAPPOINT! I Sunk literal HOURS of my life into this Legend, every weekend ALL DAY, After school Late into the night, and sometimes even playing hookie from school to play some more! I was hooked by his game! It wasn't til much much later I found out how to achieve Multiple endings, and even some other Characters i didn't know i could recruit (The internet as we know it today  was still in its infancy back then, and wasn't as easily accessible to most people). over the years i played it and never stopped loving it!
        Fast forward to 2024, AND WE HAVE A RE-MAKE (if you call a mostly graphical overhaul and some game-play mechanics  a remake, not to mention the few other 'remakes' that have been released on other hand-held consoles) that just looks phenomenal! SO far its exactly as i remember it, with some really NICE background improvement that are BEAUTIFUL, some game-play mechanics that are honestly IMO, very needed and welcome!

Not to mention the heavy amount of voice acting.

Also, the combination of having played this title before as well as the quality of life features made me decide to play this one entirely in Japanese, since I'm on my umpteenth learning kick. Notes for anyone else considering that:
- No furigana, heck even kanji disambiguation is handled clumsily like Êº¢Â≠óÔºà„Åã„Çì„ÅòÔºâ

Much of the game remains the same from the characters to the story and they key features such as the fundamentals of the battle system, item creation, and private actions. Where this remake shines though is in it's presentation and QoL features.

This remake is absolutely stunning. The visuals and lighting are incredibly gorgeous, the way the camera moves to make the scenery pop, Gemdrops did an amazing job remaking the game from scratch and updating it from the original's pre-rendered backgrounds. 

And the QoL features are great too! The ability to fast travel as well as see what private actions are available so they wont be missed is extremely helpful, as well as the change to the item creation system to give a more sandbox approach giving you access to all skills right off the bat so you can customize how you please is a welcome addition as well!

Music is good, towns are great (big JRPG town guy here) and the battle is fun. 

Only complaints would be:
1. The voice acting... not for all characters, but some are REALLY bad. Sounds like they were recorded on a macbook webcam, but honestly just made me laugh and didn't bother me too much.

2. Overwhelming at times. It may be typical of Star Ocean games, but there is so much to do between crafting weapons, leveling up like 5 different things to do one thing, side quests, private actions, etc. once I got the basics down, it wasn't so bad, but just not my thing.

76561198021449293,368260,True,0.535452723503112793,"I got way more out of this game than I bargained for. I was expecting a fun little turn-based romp, maybe 30 or 40 hours tops. As of this writing, I've spent over 100 hours in this game on a single playthrough. A lot of people have compared this game to XCOM, but I would say it's closer to Fire Emblem due to the social and relationship-building aspects, The gameplay loop is pretty satisfying, (although the exploration and Abbey gameplay could use some work), but the combat is where this game truly shines. I was skeptical going in, as I'm personally a fan of turn-based combat, but not a big fan of card-based battlers. Dear reader, the way they've balanced the card gameplay with the tactical gameplay is masterful. Each character has their own strengths and quirks, and they're extremely easy to pick up on. For example, most of Blade's cards deal Bleed damage, which typically deals damage over time, but there are some of his cards that deal more damage (or even heal him) based on how many stacks of Bleed are on an enemy. Likewise, Spider-Man excels at using environmental objects to his advantage, with many of his cards reducing (or eliminating) the resource cost associated with environment attacks. It's extremely satisfying to pull of a huge string of cards, resulting in massive damage or healing your characters back to full health while on the edge of defeat. And some characters even synergies well with each other, opening up a lot of doors to potential strategies.

My biggest gripe with this game would probably be with its story and Abbey gameplay. I don't want to spoil too much about the story, even if it is just a lot of your standard-fare superhero nonsense. The Abbey, on the other hand, felt like a lot of wasted potential. Essentially, your gameplay loop is split into three sections: Day, Battle, and Night. During the day, you prep for the battle phase. You complete research projects, train your characters, craft your decks, build support items, etc. 
You then choose a battle and proceed through combat. There are ""general"" missions, which have no impact or bearing on the story, and serve only as a means to level up your characters and gather resources. Then you have your story missions, which as you might have guessed, move the story forward. These missions often have prerequisites such as certain characters being available or a general mission being completed. Story missions will typically have pre-selected teams, with maybe 1 or 2 extra open slots for characters you choose.
After your mission is complete, you enter the Night phase of the gameplay loop, which is where I saw the most wasted potential. At the beginning of the game, you're told that the heroes you bring with you into the battle phase will be the most likely candidate for the Hangouts portion of the night phase. While this is true, what the game doesn't tell you is that the Hangouts portion is not even guaranteed to happen. Once I had finished exploring the Abbey (which honestly doesn't even take that long and once you've explored it all, there's no meaningful reason to venture back out), there were entire strings of nights where I had nothing to do and went straight to bed, starting the next day. That was really disappointing, as I really loved building my relationships with all of the heroes and getting to know more about them, especially the lesser-known ones like Nico and Magik, but the game seems to limit the amount of growth you can accomplish in any one playthrough, perhaps giving you a reason to go through New Game+ after the credits have rolled.

All in all, I was extremely satisfied with the majority of this game. I even picked up and played through all the DLC which, while fun, didn't have much impact on improving the overall narrative of the game. I would typically feel like after 100 hours a game would overstay it's welcome, but I feel like I certainly got my money's worth out of this one."

76561197997965508,2114740,True,0.749654233455657959,"I played Blasphemous 2 directly after completing the first game and I didn't expect them to be so different! Where Blasphemous one felt more like a Soulslike with Metroid elements, Blasphemous 2 is quite clearly a Metroidvania.

Unlike the first game your upgrades aren't just simple items that make platform appear or make you immune to poison but instead are mobility upgrades such as double jump, air dash, and wall climbing. A major difference is that the game was designed so that you must find all of these upgrades to advance deeper and deeper into the game. It's a classic case where you find a new power-up and then backtrack to explore more of the map.

The combat in Blasphemous 2 is also quite a bit different. With all of the mobility upgrades it's much faster and in my opinion easier. Instead of needing to learn timings to parry like the first game you can instead reliably dodge almost all attacks in the game. It's kind of a shame but the risk feels too high for parrying in this game and the reward is far too small and sometimes the knockback prevents it from being worth it at all.  There are three weapons in this game as opposed to just the sword in the first game and all of them are fun to use with unique perks and playstyles.  You pick one weapon at the start but you end up needing all three as they offer unique interactions with the environment that are required to progress. They all have separate upgrade skill trees and by the end of the game I was able to max two of them out. You can swap between the weapons at any time in combat which is fun when you prefer one or the other against a specific enemy.

Secrets in Blasphemous 2 was much, much easier to find in my opinion which is probably the result of all the mobility power-ups being a requirement to progress in the game. You aren't going to get locked out of finding most things because you missed something in the first hour or two of the game like Blasphemous 1. There's still a lot to find here though and I think if exploration is your thing you won't be disappointed by the amount of content in this game.

The art and sound was just as fantastic in this game as the original. I do miss some of the creepier body horror designs from the original but there were plenty of unsettling looking npcs, bosses, and enemies. 

I feel like this sequel had less gimmicky bosses than the original and the boss fights were much more consistently good, even if some of them were a bit on the easier side. The penultimate boss is quite the difficulty spike!

If the gameplay of Blasphemous 1 wasn't your thing you might want to check this one out if you're a Metroidvania fan because I thought that overall it was fantastic."

	As is often the case, one wishes for a neutral thumb on Steam. I would use it here if I could.  The game is ok, but a downgrade in pretty much every way from the original. If you liked Blasphemous 1 and can get this on sale, it's worth a play.

[h1]In-depth analysis:[/h1]

[h2]Negatives:[/h2]
[list]
	[*]Input lag is common, making it hard to dodge consistently. You'll often find yourself attacking or dodging in the wrong direction because your input was ignored
	[*]Stop time abilities don't work on missiles or spells?? 
	[*]Completing weapon skill trees is dependent on 100%ing the map and finding every obscure skillpoint with no way to track them in game
	[*]Important main quest can bug out causing an important character to die because you never see them before the boss room like you are supposed to
	[*]Successfully blocking results in enemies standing inside you a lot, causing damage anyway
	[*]Story seems quite flat and without nuance. You won't find any really cool secret quests or endings here. [spoiler]Just one ""secret"" ending that you can't miss.[/spoiler]
	[*]The bosses are really uninspired and easy.  Don't look for any interesting non-humanoid bosses in this one. Their idea of ""hard"" is having the bosses spam spells at you forever. This isn't difficult, just boring as you spend 30 seconds dodging spells waiting for a chance to attack again. In fact, you get so much healing you can facetank most bosses.
	[*]Unlike the first game, cut scenes are in a different art style that lacks any charm or congruence. They look like any generic Netflix anime.
	[*]Multiple weapons seems really cool at first but then you realize the mace is just better 90% of the time, 10% for when you feel like blocking the candelabra spear guys. Since the weapon level points are so hard to get you are better off just maxing out one weapon and sticking with it.
	[*]There are very few new executions. Most new enemies have the same one where you just wrap them in vines.  A big cut corner here.
[/list]
	
[h2]Positives:[/h2]
[list]
	[*]More Blasphemous if you really like the first game
	[*]Falling or landing on spikes is no longer an instant death
	[*]Pixel art is amazing
	[*]Music is amazing
	[*]The figurine altar is a really cool idea

76561197991340735,2114740,False,0.547932684421539307,"I really like this game. They've retained, for the most part, what made the original game such a good one, although the tone seems not quite as dark and disturbing as the previous entry. Combat feels much better than in the previous one.

However, the game has had sound issues for players for at least the past six months, causing areas to lose background music, and even in some extreme cases, enemy attack sounds. Unfortunately this sound bug seems to negatively affect some of the weapons, causing them to get queued and playing even if you get up from a knock-down. Needless to say, this makes the game far harder during these segments, as you can't count on sound cues.

And despite the Steam forums saying the issue is under investigation, nothing seems to have happened for the last six months. It is solely due to these sound issues and the team's apparent lack of interest in fixing the problem, that I am not recommending this game."
76561198025111058,2114740,True,0.542483627796173096,"2 Blas 2 Phemous. If you liked Blasphemous, you'll love this 2 more. If you never played the original then you can have a great time in this one as well, no need to experience the first (though I'd recommend it just for the hell of it). Immaculate vibes, the devs understand what's required for a great Metroidvania and they deliver on all fronts. Great art design, story that is reminiscent of a souls game, great soundtrack and sound design, and excellent pacing and map construction. Up there in the top echelon of the genre."
76561198812528959,2114740,True,0.540828108787536621,"Blasphemous 2 is an incredibly beautiful and atmospheric game. Frequently, I found myself just coming to a halt in an area and letting all of the atmosphere soak in. The backgrounds, each oozing character and style, the music, the subtle ambient sound effects... it all comes together to make a truly immersive experience, something which could finally fill the demon's souls ps3 edition shaped hole in my chest.
And that is only the atmosphere - underneath is an incredibly fun combat system with more depth than the first instalment, fun bossfights and engaging puzzle platforming. Also, the amount of secrets and optional challenges to discover and master was very fun.
Highly recommended to anyone who enjoyed the first game, souls fans and people who enjoy their games with a hefty dose of atmosphere!"
76561198081339264,2114740,True,0.529242038726806641,"Blasphemous 2, is just as chilling and strange as the first one creatively, if not more in some regards. Combined with some rather fun new game play mechanics, the game offers a worth wile experience to those that enjoyed the first game. However, there are a few regards where I feel the game does not live up or meet the expectations I had from the first game. None that ruin the experience, but simply left me underwhelmed by the end of the game.

The good: Each of the three weapons that you can choose from all offer unique trades offs; the dagger and rapier attack very quickly which allows you to stay mobile. However, they do the least damage per individual hit and this makes them not as fun to choose as a first weapon, it's not until you get an upgrade that increases their damage considerably, the catch is that if you take damage, this buff goes away until you land enough hits without taking damage to get the buff back. Personally, this is my favorite weapon. Next you have you sword that let's you deal a solid amount per hit, but swings a little slower. it's unique characteristic is that when it's buff meter is charged up, you can activate it to heal back some health in quick succession. The sword is very fun, but a little generic out of the three. The last weapon hits like a truck and uses mana instead of it's own separate meter. When you activate it, it does fire damage and hits a lot hard, the catch to this one is that there is no blocking with it, better be ready to dodge.

Each of the weapons have different play styles, each of them having their own particularly helpful uses. In terms of combat, you are not required to use any of the weapons in specific, however for traversal mechanics throughout the game, you will need to use them. 

The pixel art in this game is impeccable, this is one area that I can say has improved in every aspect. This applies to both enemies, and environmental art as well. 

Now onto the parts of the game where I have mixed feelings on...

The music, there are some absolute bangers in the soundtrack, and Carlos Viola delivered in SOME of the environmental soundtracks. There are 6 songs from the OST that I cared for, the rest were completely forgettable. It's a damn shame because Blasphemous 1 is easily a contender for my favorite game OST. There was only one boss theme in this game that I have kept listening to outside of the game.  Outside of that, I can hardly remember the other boss OST's which sucked. The first game had kick ass boss tracks, sure some of them had similar background melodies, but each of them brought a sense of excitement or 'oh shit this is one badass motherfucker'. You really don't get that with B2. 

Next is the boss fight designs themselves, there were 3 bosses that I actively had a challenge with, the rest were pretty easy. That and the bosses themselves just lacked personality that you could feel from the bosses of the first game. Maybe that is not the best way to put it, but I know that I can distinctly remember each boss's appearance and that was reflected in their behavior. That being said the concept that they were going for milestone boss fights was cool. Legendary penitents corrupted by the miracle (or something else? Story was a bit harder to follow in this one.)

Next is the tree hand that has made up the penitent ones hand, there are a couple of execution animations with it. That is it, it would have been cool if they did more with it, but they didn't. Like the idea, should of ran with it instead of walked.

Outside of that, the game is great, truthfully, the first one is more fun. This one has more standard metroidvania mechanics, but that is what I feel was part of the game's reason for stumbling. The first game did not need those mechanics, and instead I feel the time and effort should have been spent elsewhere. If you are a new comer to the franchise or to the genre play the first one. If you have a blast pick up the second one and you will have a good time still."
76561198098956900,2114740,False,0.527443468570709229,"Compared to the first game this feels like a downgrade.
The first action I was taught had a buggy animation (Veredicto activation).
The entire story feels shallow compared to the first part and none of the NPCs or areas captured me in the same way. 
The combat can be more dynamic due to the multiple weapons, but it is heavily limited by the fact that while weapons can be changed mid combat, your load out cannot. Many bosses also have a clear focus on one weapon and using any other is simply not intended. 
The animations are a downgrade to the pixelated style of the previous one.

In my opinion the worst part is that the second to last boss has startup and transition animations longer than the actual fight. It is also one of the hardest fights in the game. At that point I already did not enjoy myself anymore and this fight convinced me that I have better things to do than watch a 30 second cut scene for the 20th time. Some other bosses also have lengthy introductions and none of them can be skipped."
76561197995814648,2114740,False,0.527443468570709229,"First Blasphemous was a far superior game in every way possible.

Blasphemous 2 is full of bugs which some can [u] ruin your entire playthrough requiring you to start a new run [/u] in the hopes that said bugs don't happen again. 

You have to find some hidden NPCs in order to unlock the true ending which they can bug out when you trigger the event and they disappear forever rendering your 100% run void (happened to me with one of the ""Sisters""). Some other players have reported the same thing happening with Cherubs (the little angels). This bug crushed my soul as I was almost done with my first, complete playthrough. 

Some of my gripes:
- The story in this game is a lot mindless mumbling of fancy words with terrible cohesion between events.
- Almost all boss fights are hardly a challenge.
- There's no NG+ like the first game.
- The devs clearly cared more about launching a game title with ""Blasphemous"" more than they cared for an enjoyable, authentic story. 

Blasphemous was an absolute 10/10 for me, but Blasphemous 2 was maybe a [b] 6.5/10 [/b] so I suggest you buy it on sale if truly interested.

76561198095402041,2114740,True,0.518072307109832764,"Solid sequel. It failed to match the original's mystique, and it compromised the original's identity for the sake of broader appeal. The result is an admittedly quality experience from start to finish, but one that will not stick with me in the same way as the original still does."
76561198193789779,2114740,False,0.514285683631896973,"Blasphemous 2 is pretty disappointing, it feels like they haven't learned anything from their last game. The art style is not as good as in the first game, the enemy variety is severely lacking and the combat is even easier.  They have bloated the game with a bunch of new weapons, upgrades and abilities that you will never use because everything dies so quickly anyway. The map is very unintuitive and annoying to use, which makes backtracking a chore. Lastly, the different menus are a pain in the ass to navigate because of the horrible keybindings that you can't even change. The only good thing is the soundtrack.

If you really loved the first game and you want some more Blasphemous, there's a slight chance you might like this one. Otherwise, there are much better metroidvanias to play out there."
76561198161141911,2114740,True,0.5,"Pretty much the same game has the original with slight improvements. It almost the same structure too. The movement is more refined as well as how you navigate the map. Some really cool bosses and the combat is really good just like the original. Definitely worth playing if you're a fan of metroidvanias.
7/10 (Good)"

Thank you EA for ruining one of the last decent racing game franchises and one of my favorite ones as well, as for Codemasters, hope the money was worth it for you guys cuz for me and most people it definitely wasn't."

76561198060596568,1849250,False,0.522305011749267578,"I have a decade of my life into Dirt (on other accounts) Ive been a sim racer for a long time. (also a game dev for 20 years) We were SO EXCITED for this new franchise and WRC. Not only is it the worst WRC game of them all, but its nowhere near Dirt Rally 2. Lags on a 3090 at 1080p (its unreal 5, what do you expect). Bland tracks with few replicated assets. Everything is just the same perfectly squared off dirt road like they just cut through the terrain with an EZ Roads addon to unreal. Go back and play WRC 9 to see some REALLY interesting stuff. Also, no VR, which is the number one reason everyone was excited for this release. Codemasters is the best when it comes to VR sim games. But... Its Unreal 5. Games can't even run on a single monitor let alone VR."

I thought it would at least look similar to Dirt 2.0, I wasnt expecting to see trees through walls, or 8-bit models in the menu. After 2 min of driving I had to call it quits. If you have NASA specs for your PC itll probably look decent, but if your pc isnt $20,000 just stick with the Dirt series."
